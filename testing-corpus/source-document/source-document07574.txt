TREES IN ASSEMBLAGES.

The subject of Trees cannot be exhausted by treating them as individuals or species, even with
a full enumeration of their details. Some trees possess but little interest, except as they
are grouped in assemblages of greater or less extent. A solitary Fir or Spruce, for example,
when standing in an inclosure or by the roadside, is a stiff and disagreeable object; but a
deep forest of Firs is not surpassed in grandeur by one of any other species. These trees must
be assembled in extensive groups to affect us agreeably; while the Elm, the Oak, and other
wide-spreading trees, are grand objects of sight, when standing alone, or in any other situation.

I will not detain the reader with a prolix account of the classification of trees in assemblages,
but simply glance at a few points. The Romans used four different words to express these distinctions.
When they spoke of a wood with reference to its timber, they used the word silva; sal, was
a collection of wild-wood in the mountains; nemus, a smaller collection, partaking of cultivation,
and answering to our ideas of a grove; lucus was a wood, of any description, which was set
apart for religious purposes, or dedicated to some Deity. In the English language we can make
these distinctions intelligible only by the use of adjectives. A forest is generally understood
to be a wild-wood of considerable extent, retaining all its natural features. A grove is a
smaller assemblage of trees, not crowded together, but possessing very generally their full
proportions, and divested of their undergrowth. Other inferior groups are designated as copse
and thicket. The words park, clump, arboretum, and the like, are mere technical terms, that
do not come into use in a general description of Nature.

Groves, fragments of forest, and inferior groups only are particularly interesting in landscape.
An unbroken forest of wide extent makes but a dreary picture and an unattractive journey, on
account of its gloomy uniformity. Hence the primitive state of the earth, before it was modified
by human hands, must have been sadly wanting in those romantic features that render a scene
the most attractive. Nature must be combined with Art, however simple and rude, and associated
with human life, to become deeply affecting to the imagination. But it is not necessary that
the artificial objects of a landscape should be of a grand historical description, to produce
these agreeable effects: humble objects, indeed, are the most consonant with Nature's sublime
aspects, because they manifest no seeming endeavor to rival them. In the deep solitary woods,
the sight of a woodman's hut in a clearing, of a farmer's cottage, or of a mere sheepfold,
immediately awakens a tender interest, and enlivens the scene with a tinge of romance.

The earth must have been originally covered with forest, like the American continent in the
time of Columbus. This has in all cases disappeared, as population has increased; and groves,
fragments of wild-wood, small groups, and single trees have taken its place. Great Britain,
once renowned for its extensive woods, now exhibits only smaller assemblages, chiefly of an
artificial character, which are more interesting to the landscape-gardener than to the lover
of Nature's primitive charms. Parks, belts, arboretums, and clipped hedge-rows, however useful
as contributing to pleasure, convenience, or science, are not the most interesting features
of wood-scenery. But the customs of the English nobility, while they have artificialized all
the fairest scenes in the country, and ruined them for the eyes of the poet or the painter,
have been the means of preserving some valuable forests, which under other circumstances would
have been utterly destroyed. A deer-forest belonging to the Duke of Athol comprises four hundred
thousand acres; the forest of Farquharson contains one hundred and thirty thousand acres; and
several others of smaller extent are still preserved as deer-parks. Thus do the luxuries of
the rich tend, in some instances, to preserve those natural objects of which they are in general
the principal destroyers.

Immense forests still overspread a great part of Northern Russia, through which it has been
asserted that a squirrel might traverse hundreds of miles, without touching the ground, by
leaping from tree to tree. Since the general adoption of railroad travelling, however, great
ravages have been made in these forests, and not many years will be required to reduce them
to fragments. In the South of Europe a great part of the territory is barren of woods, and
the climate has suffered from this cause, which has diminished the bulk of the streams and
increased the severity of droughts. But Nature has established a partial remedy for the evil
arising from the imprudent destruction of forests, in lofty and precipitous mountains, that
serve not only to perpetuate moisture for the supply of rain to the neighboring countries,
but contribute also to preserve the timber in their inaccessible ravines. Were it not for this
safeguard of mountains, the South of Europe would ere this have become a desert, from the destruction
of its forests, like Sahara, whose barrenness was anciently produced by the same cause.

Most of the territory of North America is still comparatively a wilderness; but in the United
States the forests have been so extensively invaded, that they seldom exhibit any distinct
outlines, and few of them possess the character of unique assemblages. They are but scattered
fragments of the original forest, through which the settlers have made their irregular progress
from east to west, diversifying it with roads, farms, and villages. The recent clearings are
palisaded by tall trees, exhibiting a naked outline of skeleton timber, without any attractions.
It is in the old States only that we see anything like a picturesque grouping of woods; and
here, the absence of art and design, in the formation and relative disposition of these groups,
gives them a peculiar interest to the lover of natural scenery. There is a charm, therefore,
in New-England landscape, existing nowhere else in equal degree; but this is rapidly giving
place to those artificial improvements that are destined to ruin the face of the country, which
owes its present attractions to the spontaneous efforts of Nature, modified only by the unartistic
operations of a simple agriculture.

Travelling in a forest, though delightful as an occasional recreation, is, when continued many
hours in succession, unless one be engaged in scientific researches, very monotonous and wearisome.
Even the productions of a forest are not so various as those of a tract in which all the different
conditions of wildness and culture are intermingled. A view of an unbroken wilderness from
an elevation is equally monotonous. Wood must be blended with other forms of landscape, with
pasture and tillage, with roads, houses, and farms, to convey to the mind the most agreeable
sensations. The monotony of unbroken forest-scenery is partially relieved in the autumn by
the mixed variety of tints belonging to the different trees; but this does not wholly subdue
the prevailing expression of dreariness and gloom.

Nothing can surpass the splendor of this autumnal pageantry, as beheld in the Green Mountains
of Vermont and Western Massachusetts, in the early part of October. This region abounds in
Sugar-Maples, which are very beautifully tinted, and in a sufficient variety of other trees
to delight the eye with every specious hue. A remarkable appearance may always be observed
in Maples. Some trees of this kind are entirely green, with the exception perhaps of a single
bough, which is of a bright crimson or scarlet. Sometimes the lower half of the foliage will
be green, while the upper part is entirely crimsoned, resembling a spire of flame rising out
of a mass of verdure. In other cases this order is reversed, and the tree presents the appearance
of a green spire rising out of flame. We see no end to the variety of these apparently capricious
phenomena, which some have explained by supposing the colored branches to be affected with
partial disease that hastens their maturity: but this can hardly be admitted as the true explanation,
as such appearances exist when no other symptoms of malady can be discovered.

So much has been said and written of late in regard to the tints of autumn leaves, that the
writer of this cannot be expected to advance anything new concerning them. Let me remark, however,
that these beautiful tintings are not due to the action of frost, which is, on the contrary,
highly prejudicial to them, as we may observe on several different occasions. If, for example,
a frost should occur in September of sufficient intensity to cut down the tender annuals of
our gardens,--after this, when the tints begin to appear, the outer portion of the foliage
that was touched by the frost will exhibit a sullied and rusty hue. The effects of these early
frosts are seldom apparent while the leaves are green, except on close inspection; for a very
intense frost is required to sear and roll up the leaves. Early autumnal frosts seldom do more
than to injure their capacity to receive a fine tint when they become mature.

The next occasion that renders the injurious effects of frost apparent is later in the season,
after the tints are very generally developed. Every severe frost that happens at this period
impairs their lustre, as we may perceive on any day succeeding a frosty night, when the woods,
which were previously in their gayest splendor, will be faded to a duller and more uniform
shade,--as if the whole mass had been dipped into a brownish dye, leaving the peculiar tints
of each species dimly conspicuous through this shading. The most brilliant and unsullied hues
are displayed in a cool, but not frosty autumn, succeeding a moderate summer. Very warm weather
in autumn hastens the coloring process, and renders the hues proportionally transient. I have
known Maple woods, early in October, to be completely embrowned and stripped of their leaves
by two days of summer heat. Cool days and nights, unattended with frost, are the favorable
conditions for producing and preserving the beauty of autumnal wood-scenery.

The effects of heat and frost are not so apparent in Oak woods, which have a more coriaceous
and persistent foliage than other deciduous trees: but Oaks do not attain the perfection of
their beauty, until the Ash, the Maple, and the Tupelo--the glory of the first period of autumn--have
shed a great portion of their leaves. The last-named trees are in their splendor during a period
of about three weeks after the middle of September, varying with the character of the season.

Oaks are not generally tinted until October, and are brightest near the third week of this
month, preserving their lustre, in great measure, until the hard frosts of November destroy
the leaves. The colors of the different Oaks are neither so brilliant nor so variegated as
those of Maples; but they are more enduring, and serve more than those of any other woods to
give character to our autumnal landscapes.

It would be difficult to convey to the mind of a person who had never witnessed this brilliant,
but solemn pageantry of the dying year, a clear idea of its magnificence. Nothing else in Nature
will compare with it: for, though flowers are more beautiful than tinted leaves, no assemblage
of flowers, or of flowering trees and shrubs, can produce such a deeply affecting scene of
beauty as the autumn woods. If we would behold them In their greatest brilliancy and variety,
we must journey during the first period of the Fall of the Leaf in those parts of the country
where the Maple, the Ash, and the Tupelo are the prevailing timber. If we stand, at this time,
on a moderate elevation affording a view of a wooded swamp rising into upland and melting imperceptibly
into mountain landscape, we obtain a fair sight of the different assemblages of species, as
distinguished by their tints. The Oaks will be marked, at this early period, chiefly by their
unaltered verdure. In the lowland the scarlet and crimson hues of the Maple and the Tupelo
predominate, mingled with a superb variety of colors from the shrubbery, whose splendor is
always the greatest on the borders of ponds and water-courses, and frequently surpasses that
of the trees. As the plain rises into the hill-side, the Ash-trees may be distinguished by
their peculiar shades of salmon, mulberry, and purple, and the Hickories by their invariable
yellows. The Elm, the Lime, and the Buttonwood are always blemished and rusty: they add no
brilliancy to the spectacle, serving only to sober and relieve other parts of the scenery.

When the second period of the Fall of the Leaf has arrived, the woods that were first tinted
have mostly become leafless. The grouping of different species is, therefore, very apparent
at this time,--some assemblages presenting the denuded appearance of winter, some remaining
still green, while the Oaks are the principal attraction, with an intermixture of a few other
species, whose foliage has been protected and the development of their hues retarded by some
peculiarity of situation. Green rows of Willows may also be seen by road-sides in damp places,
and irregular groups of them near the water-courses. The foreign trees--seldom found in woods--are
still unchanged, as we may observe wherever there is a row of European Elms, Weeping Willows,
or a hedge-row of Privet.

One might suppose that a Pine wood must look particularly sombre in this grand spectacle of
beauty; but it cannot be denied that in those regions where there is a considerable proportion
of Pines the perfection of this scenery is witnessed. Something is needful to relieve the eye
as it wanders over such a profusion of brilliant colors. Pine woods provide this relief, and
cause the tinted forest groups to stand out in greater prominence. In many districts where
Pines were the original growth, they still constitute the larger sylvan assemblages, while
the deciduous trees stand in scattered groups on the edge of the forest, and the contiguous
plain. The verdurous Pine wood forms a picturesque groundwork to set off the various groups
in front of it; and the effect of a scarlet Oak or Tupelo rising like a spire of flame in the
midst of verdure is far more striking than if it stood where it was unaffected by contrast.

The cause of the superior tinting of the American forest, compared with that of Europe, has
never been satisfactorily explained, though it seems to be somewhat inexplicably connected
with the brightness of the American climate. It is a subject that has not engaged the attention
of scientific travellers, who seem to have regarded it as worthy only of the describer of scenery.
It may, however, deserve more attention as a scientific fact than has been generally supposed,--particularly
as one of the phenomena that perhaps distinguish the productions of the eastern from those
of the western coasts of the two grand divisions of the earth. I have observed that the Smoke-tree,
which is a Sumach from China, and the Cydonia Japonica, are as brightly colored in autumn as
any of our indigenous shrubs; while the Silver-Maple, which, though indigenous in the Western
States, probably originated on the western coast of America, shows none of the fine tinting
so remarkable in the other American Maples. These facts have led me to conjecture that this
superior tinting of the autumnal foliage may be peculiar to the eastern coasts both of the
Old and the New Continent, in the northern hemisphere. May not this phenomenon bear some relation
to the colder winters and the hotter summers of the eastern compared with the western coasts?
I offer this suggestion as a query, not as a theory, and with the hope that it may induce travellers
to make some particular observations in reference to it.

The indigenous trees of America, or rather of the Atlantic side of this continent, are remarkable
not only for their superior autumnal hues, but also for the shorter period during which the
foliage remains on the trees and retains its verdure. Our fruit-trees, which are all exotics,
retain their foliage long after our forest-trees are leafless; and if we visit an arboretum
in the latter part of October, we may select the American from the foreign species, by observing
that the latter are still green, while the others are either entirely denuded, or in that colored
array which immediately precedes the fall of the leaf. The exotics may likewise be distinguished
in the spring by their precocity,--their leaves being out a week or ten days earlier than the
leaves of our trees. Hence, if we take both the spring and autumn into the account, the foreign,
or rather the European species, show a period of verdure of three or four weeks' greater duration
than the American species. Many of the former, like the Weeping Willow, do not lose their verdure,
nor shed their leaves, until the first wintry blasts of November freeze them upon their branches
and roll them into a crisp.

In a natural forest there is a very small proportion of perfectly formed trees; and these occur
only in such places as permit some individuals to stand isolated from the rest, and to spread
out their branches to their full extent. When we walk in a forest, we observe several conditions
which are favorable to this full expansion of their forms. On the borders of a pond or morass,
or of an extensive quarry, the trees extend their branches into the opening, but, as they are
cramped on the opposite side, they are only half developed. But this expansion takes place
on the side that is exposed to view: hence the incomparable beauty of a wood on the borders
of a pond, or on the banks of a river, as viewed from the water; also of a wood on the outside
of an islet in a lake or river.

Fissures or cavities sometimes occur in a large rock, allowing a solitary tree that has become
rooted there to attain its full proportions. It is in such places, and on sudden eminences
that rise above the forest-level, on a precipice, for example, that overlooks the surrounding
wood, that the forest shows individual trees possessing the characters of standards, like those
we see by the roadsides and in the open field. We must conclude, therefore, that a primitive
forest must contain but a very small proportion of perfect trees: these are, for the most part,
the occupants of land cleared by cultivation, and may be found also among the sparse growth
of timber that has come up in pasture land, where the constant browsing of cattle prevents
the formation of any dense assemblages.

In the opinion of Whately, grandeur is the prevailing character of a forest, and beauty that
of a grove. This distinction may seem to be correct, when such collections of wood exhibit
all their proper characters: but perfectly unique forms of wood are seldom found in this country,
where almost all the timber is of spontaneous growth. We have genuine forests; but other forms
of wood are of a mixed character, and we have rather fragments of forest than legitimate groves.
In the South of Europe many of the woods are mere plantations, in which the trees were first
set in rows, with straight avenues, or vistas, passing directly through them from different
points. In an assemblage of this kind there can be nothing of that interesting variety observed
in a natural forest, and which is manifestly wanting even in woods planted with direct reference
to the attainment of these natural appearances. "It is curious to see," as Gilpin remarks,
"with what richness of invention, if I may so speak, Nature mixes and intermixes her trees,
and shapes them into such a wonderful variety of groups and beautiful forms. Art may admire
and attempt to plant and to form combinations like hers; but whoever observes the wild combinations
of a forest and compares them with the attempts of Art has little taste, if he do not acknowledge
with astonishment the superiority of Nature's workmanship."

When a tract is covered with a dense growth of tall trees, especially of Pines, which have
but little underbrush, the wood represents overhead a vast canopy of verdure supported by innumerable
lofty pillars. No one could enter these dark solitudes without feeling a deep impression of
sublimity, especially if it be an hour of general stillness of the winds. The voices of animals
and of birds, particularly the hammering of the woodpecker, serve to magnify our perceptions
of grandeur. A very slight sound, during a calm in one of these deep woods, like the ticking
of a clock in a vast hall, has a distinctness almost startling, especially if there be but
little undergrowth. These feeble sounds afford one a more vivid sense of the magnitude of the
place than louder sounds, that differ less from those we hear in the open plain. The canopy
of foliage overhead and the absence of undergrowth are favorable to those reverberations which
are so perceptible in a Pine wood.

In a grove we experience different sensations. Here pleasantness and cheerfulness are combined,
and the feeling of grandeur is excited only perhaps by the sight of some noble tree. In a grove
the trees are generally well formed, many of them being nearly perfect in their proportions.
Their shadows are cast separately upon the ground, which is green beneath them as in an orchard.
If we look upon them from a near eminence, we observe a variety of outlines, and may identify
the different species by their shape, while in the forest we see one unbroken mass of foliage.
A wild-wood is frequently converted into a grove by clearing it of undergrowth and leaving
the space a grassy lawn. It may then yield us shade, coolness, and other agreeable sensations
of a cultivated wood, but the individual trees always retain their gaunt and imperfect shapes.

The greater part of the woodland of this country partakes of the characters of both forest
and grove, exhibiting a pleasant admixture of each, combined with pasture and thicket. In Great
Britain the woods are chiefly groves and parks: a wild-wood of spontaneous growth is now rare
in that country, once renowned for the extent and beauty of its forests. Most of our American
woods are fragments of forest, particularly in the Western States, where they stand out prominently,
and deform the landscape by presenting a perpendicular front of naked pillars, unrelieved by
any foliage. They remind one of those houses, in the city, which have been cut asunder to widen
a street, leaving the interior rooms and partition-walls exposed to view. These sections of
wood are the grand picturesque deformity of a country lately cleared. In the older settlements,
a recent growth of wood has in many instances come up outside of these palisades, serving in
a measure to conceal their baldness.

The most lovely appearances in landscape are caused by the spontaneous growth of miscellaneous
trees, some in dense assemblages and some in scattered groups, with here and there a few single
trees standing in open space. Such is the scenery of considerable portions of the Atlantic
States, both North and South. These varied assemblages of wood and shrubbery are the characteristic
features of the landscape in the older villages of New England, and indeed of all the States
that were established before the Revolution. But the New-England system of farming--so much
abhorred by those who wish to bring agriculture to such a state of improvement as shall make
it profitable exclusively to capitalists--has been more favorable to the sylvan beauty of the
landscape than that of any other part of the continent. At the South, especially, where agriculture
is carried on in large plantations, we see wide fields of tillage, and forest groups of corresponding
size. But the small and independent farming of New England--as favorable to general happiness
as it is to beautiful scenery--has produced a charming variety of wood, pasture, and tillage,
so agreeably intermixed that one is never weary of looking upon it. The varied surface of the
landscape, in the uneven parts which are not mountainous, has increased these advantages, producing
an endless multitude of those limited views which may be termed picturesque.

In no other part of the country are the minor inequalities of surface so frequent as in New
England: I allude to that sort of ruggedness which is unfavorable to any "mammoth" system of
agriculture, and plainly evinces that Nature and Providence have designed this part of the
country for free and independent labor. Here little meadows, of a few acres in extent, are
common, encircled by green pasture hills or by wood. A rolling surface is more favorable to
grandeur of scenery; but nothing is more beautiful than landscape formed by hills rising suddenly
out of perfect levels. As it is not my present purpose to treat of landscape in general, I
will simply remark that the barrenness of a great part of the soil of the Eastern States is
favorable to picturesque scenery. This may seem a paradoxical assertion to those who can see
no beauty except in universal fatness; but unvaried luxuriance is fatal to variety of scenes,
though it undoubtedly encourages the development of individual growth. An agreeable intermixture
of various sylvan assemblages is one of the effects of a barren soil, containing numerous fertile
tracts. Not having in general sufficient strength to produce timber, it covers itself with
diverse groups of vegetation, corresponding with the varieties of soil and surface. Thus, in
a certain degree, we are obliged to confess that beauty springs out of Nature's deficiencies.

We live in a latitude and upon a soil, therefore, which are favorable to the harmonious grouping
of vegetation. As we proceed southward, we witness a constant increase of the number of species
gathered together in a single group. Nature is more addicted at the North to the habit of classifying
her productions and of assembling them in uniform phalanxes. The painter, on this account,
finds more to interest the eye and to employ his pencil in the picturesque regions of frost
and snow; while the botanist finds more to exercise his observation in the crowded variety
that marks the region of perpetual summer.

But while vegetation is more generally social in high latitudes, several families of Northern
trees are entirely wanting in this quality. Seldom is a forest composed chiefly of Elms, Locusts,
or Willows. Oaks and Birches are associated in forests, Elms in groves, and Willows in small
groups following the courses of streams. Those Northern trees which are most eminently social,
including the two just named, are the Beech, the Maple, the Hickory, the coniferous trees,
and some others; and by the predominance of any one kind the character of the soil may be partially
determined. There is no tree that grows so abundantly in miry land, both North and South upon
this continent, as the Red Maple. It occupies immense tracts of morass in the Middle States,
and is the last tree which is found in swamps, according to Michaux, as the Birch is the last
we meet in ascending mountains. The Sugar-Maple is confined mostly to the Northeastern parts
of the continent. Poplars are not generally associated exclusively in forests; but at the point
where the Ohio and the Mississippi mingle their waters are grand forests of Deltoid Poplars,
that stamp upon the features of that region a very peculiar physiognomy.

The characteristics of different woods, composed chiefly of one family of trees, would make
an interesting study; but it would be tiresome to enter minutely into their details. Some are
distinguished by a superfluity, others by a deficiency of undergrowth. In general, Pine and
Fir woods are of the latter description, differing in this respect from deciduous woods. These
differences are most apparent in large assemblages of wood, which have a flora as well as a
fauna of their own. The same shrubs and herbaceous plants, for example, are not common to Oak
and to Pine woods. There is a difference also in the cleanness and beauty of their stems. The
gnarled habit of the Oak is conspicuous even in the most crowded forest, and coniferous woods
are apt to be disfigured by dead branches projecting from the bole. The Birch, the Poplar,
and the Beech are remarkable for the straightness, evenness, and beauty of their shafts, when
assembled in a dense wood.

Some of the most beautiful forests in high latitudes consist of White Canoe-Birches. We see
them in Massachusetts only in occasional groups, but farther north, upon river-banks, they
form woods of considerable extent and remarkable beauty; and with their tall shafts, and their
smooth white bark, resembling pillars of marble, supporting a canopy of bright green foliage,
on a light feathery spray, they constitute one of the picturesque attractions of a Northern
tour. Nature seems to indicate the native habitat of this noble tree by causing its exterior
to bear the whiteness of snow, and it would be difficult to estimate its importance to the
aboriginal inhabitants of Northern latitudes. Yellow Birch woods are not inferior in their
attractions: individual trees of this species are often distinguished among other forest timber
by extending their feathery summits above the level of the other trees.

The small White Birch is never assembled in large forest groups. Like the Alder, it seems to
be employed by Nature for the shading of her living pictures, and for producing those gradations
which are the charm of spontaneous wood-scenery. In this part of the continent, a Pitch-Pine
wood is commonly fringed with White Birches, and outside of these with a lower growth of Hazels,
Cornels, and Vacciniums, uniting them imperceptibly with the herbage of the plain. The importance
of this native embroidery is not sufficiently considered by those industrious plodders who
are constantly destroying wayside shrubbery, as if it were the pest of the farm,--nor by those
"improvers," on the other hand, who wage an eternal warfare against little spontaneous groups
of wood, as if they thought everything outside of the forest an intruder, if it was planted
by accident, and had not cost money before it was placed there. Give me an old farm, with its
stone-walls draped with Poison-Ivy and Glycine, and verdurous with a mixed array of Viburnums,
Hazels, and other wild shrubbery, harboring thousands of useful birds, and smiling over the
abundant harvests which they surround, before the finest artistical landscape in the world!

Pines are remarkably social in their habit, and cover immense tracts in high latitudes, extending
southward, on this continent, as far as the very boundary of the tropics, where they are found
side by side with the Dwarf Palm of Florida. But in the region of the true Palms the Pine is
wanting. It is worthy of remark, however, that in the fossil vegetation of the Eocene world
these two vegetable tribes are found associated. This fact, it seems to me, should be attributed
to the mixing of the mountain Pines with the Palms of the sea-level, during that revulsion
of Nature by which they were hurled into the same chaotic heap. We are not obliged to infer
from their contiguity in these geological remains, that the two species ever flourished together
in the same region.

Pine woods possess attractions of a peculiar kind: all lovers of Nature are enraptured with
them, and there is a grandeur about them which is felt at once, when we enter them. Their dark
verdure, their deep shade, their lofty height, and their branches which are ever mysteriously
murmuring, as they are swayed by the wind, render them singularly solemn and sublime. This
expression is increased by the hollow reverberating interior of the wood, caused by its clearness
and freedom from underbrush. The ground beneath is covered by a matting of fallen leaves, making
a smooth brown carpet, that renders a walk within its precincts as comfortable as in a garden.
The foliage of two summers, therefore, lies upon the surface, checking the growth of humble
vegetation, and permitting only certain species of plants to flourish with vigor.

Mushrooms of various forms and sizes spring out of these decayed leaves, often rivalling the
flowers in elegance. Monotropas, uniting some of the habits of the Fungi with the botanical
characters of the flowering plants, flourish side by side with the snowy Cypripedium and the
singular Coral-Weed. The evergreen Dewberry, a delicate species of Rubus, trails its glossy
leaves over the turfs, and mingles its beaded fruit with the scarlet berries of the Mitchella.
The Pyrola, named by the Indians Pipsissewa, and regarded by them as a specific for consumption,
suspends its pale purple flowers in beautiful umbels, as if to invite the feeble invalid to
accept its proffered remedies. Variety, indeed, may be found in these deep shades; but it exists
without that profusion which in more favored situations often benumbs our susceptibility to
the charms of Nature.

The edging of a Pine wood depends on the character of the soil. The Pitch-Pine, that delights
in sandy plains, is embroidered at the North by White Birches; and if a road be cut through
a wood of this kind, these graceful trees immediately spring up in abundance by the wayside.
If a pond occurs in the middle of a Pine wood, its margin is covered first with low bushes,
such as the Andromeda, the Myrica, and the sweet-scented Azalea, then Alders and Willows rise
between them and the forest. On the side of the pond that is bounded by high gravelly banks,
the margin will be covered by Poplars and Birches. The White Pine, the most noble and the most
beautiful tree of the whole coniferous tribe, predominates in the New-England forest; though
some wide tracts are covered with the more homely Pitch-Pines, which are the trees that scent
the atmosphere on damp still days with their delightful terebinthine odors. The woods in the
vicinity of Concord, N.H., on the banks of the Merrimack, known by the poetic appellation of
"The Dark Plains", are of this description. In still higher latitudes the dark, majestic Firs
become the prevailing timber, and are regarded as typical of sub-arctic regions, where they
are accompanied, as if to form a striking and cheerful contrast with their melancholy grandeur,
by groups of graceful Birches, and lively, tremulous Poplars.

The Pine-Barrens of the Southern States are celebrated as healthful retreats for the inhabitants
of seaport towns, whither they resort in summer for security from the prevailing fevers. They
are of a mixed character, consisting of the Northern Pitch-Pine, the Broom-Pine, and the Cypress,
intermixed with Red Maples, Sweet Gums, and other deciduous trees. The Pines, however, are
the dominant growth: but here they do not grow so compactly as in colder regions, standing
widely apart, with a frequent intervening growth of Willows and shrubbery. The sparseness of
these woods may be in part attributed to the practice of tapping the trees for their turpentine,
which has caused them for a century past to be gradually thinned by consequent decay. Their
tall, gaunt forms and almost branchless trunks show that they obtained their principal growth
in a dense wood.

The first time I entered one of these Pine-Barrens was some years since, in the month of June,
when vegetation was in its prime, before the summer droughts had seared the green herbage,
and when the flowering trees and shrubs were in all their glory. During my botanical rambles
in the wood, I was struck with the multitude of beautiful flowers in its shady retreats,--seeming
the more numerous to me, as I had previously confined my researches to Northern woods. The
Phlox grew here in all its native grace and delicacy, where it had never known the fostering
hand of Art. Crimson Rhexias, called by the inhabitants Deer-Weed, were distributed among the
grassy knolls, like clusters of Picotees. Variegated Passion-Flowers were conspicuous on the
bare white sand that checkered the ground, displaying their emblematic forms on their low repent
vines, and reminding the wanderer in these almost trackless solitudes of that Faith which was
founded on humility and crowned with martyrdom. Here, too, the Spiderwort of our gardens, in
a meeker form of beauty and with a paler radiance, luxuriated under the protection of the wood.
Already I observed the predominance of luxuriant vines, indicating our nearness to the tropic,
wreathed gayly over the tall and branchless trunks of the trees: some, like the Bignonia, in
a full blaze of crimson; others, like the Climbing Fern, draping the trees in continual verdure.

These Pines constitute a great part of the timber of the flat country between the mountains
and the coast, and render a journey through that region singularly monotonous and gloomy. In
the low grounds, a considerable proportion of the wood consists of the Southern Cypress, a
graceful and magnificent tree, whose appearance would be very lively and cheerful, were it
not for the abundance of long trailing "moss" (usnea) that hangs, like funereal drapery, from
its branches, and darkens the whole forest. This parasitic appendant wreathes the woods sometimes
almost in darkness, especially in those immense tracts on the borders of the Mexican Gulf that
consist entirely of Cypress. There it has been poetically styled the "Garlands of Death," as
significant of the fevers that prevail wherever it is abundant.

It is remarkable that the two extremes of climate are distinguished by the predominance of
evergreens in their vegetation. Thus, the acicular-leaved trees, consisting of Pines and their
congeners, mark the cold-temperate and sub-arctic zones, in north latitude,--while Myrtles,
Magnolias, and other broad-leaved evergreens, mark the equatorial and tropical regions. The
deciduous trees belong properly to the temperate zones, and constitute, indeed, the most interesting
of all arborescent vegetation.

With regard to the age of forests, it may be affirmed that there are some undoubtedly in existence
which are coeval with the earliest history of nations; but no individual trees are of such
antiquity. Like nations, the assemblage may be perpetual, while the members that compose it
are constantly perishing, and leaving their places to be supplied by others of more recent
origin. Probably the earth does not contain forests in which any tree exceeds a thousand years
of age, though the oldest forest extant may be as ancient as the Chinese Empire; for the oldest
trees are not found in dense assemblages, but are probably such as have grown singly in isolated
situations. As soon as a tree in a forest begins to feel the infirmities of age, its place
is usurped by some young and more vigorous neighbor, and it is gradually deprived of subsistence
in this unequal contest. The tempests and tornadoes, it may be added, which occasionally sweep
over a country, commonly make the oldest and tallest trees their victims; for events seem to
follow the same course in a forest as in human society. The most vigorous growers at any period
continue to flourish a certain length of time at the expense of others; but when they have
risen above the common level, they become marks for destruction,--they fall before certain
inimical forces that do not reach their more humble companions.

It was the opinion of Humboldt, that, if any tract of wooded country deserves to be considered
a part of the great "primeval forest", it is "that boundless district which, in the torrid
zone of South America, connects the river-basins of the Amazon and the Orinoco." This tract,
unequalled in extent by any other forest in the world, occupies an area of more than a thousand
miles square. In this vast chaos of teeming vegetation, trees of the largest dimensions are
connected by an undergrowth of vines and shrubbery which is almost impenetrable. Immense rivers
and their tributaries intersect the forest in all directions, and constitute the only avenues
of commercial intercourse. This impervious thicket is like a huge wall, separating near neighbors,
rendering them, as it were, inhabitants of distant regions, and obliging them to make long
and circuitous river journeys before they can hold communication.

Here the leaves of the trees are always green, and flowers appear in constant succession; but
the surface of the ground is without herbage, for the darkness of the wood is fatal to all
humble vegetation. The small plants are mostly parasites, thousands inserting their roots into
the bark of trees and garlanding them with beauty. Those that take root in the ground show
but few leaves or flowers, until they have clambered upwards, through the underwood, into the
light of heaven. Almost the only relief afforded the sight, in this vast solitude, comes from
the rivers and other collections of water, over whose expanse the eye revels with the delight
we feel on emerging from the gloom of a cavern. Every object seems to be struggling to get
outside of this chaotic growth, where it can obtain the genial influence of the sun: for near
the surface of the ground are perpetual shade and hideous entanglement.

In this primeval forest we must not expect to realize any of our poetical ideas of the primitive
residence of the first human family. Here are no Arcadian scenes of peace and rural felicity.
On all sides we behold an undying competition for light and life, among both plants and animals.
We are reminded here of life in a crowded city, where the excessive abundance of supplies for
human wants imported from the surrounding country causes a still greater superfluity of population,
and produces a struggle for a livelihood more severe than in a rural district of gravel and
boulders. The oases of this great wilderness are those places in which there is an absence
of the general fertility: barrenness in such circumstances is a relief,--because it allows
both freedom and repose.

This wood is the nursery of all descriptions of monsters, living chiefly in trees. On their
branches and in their tangled recesses, adorned with all sorts of foliage and flowers, creatures
the most terrible and the most loathsome are seen crowding and crouching in close proximity
to the most beautiful forms of living things. They fill the air with their discordant utterances,
and allow no permanent silence or tranquillity. Hours of periodical stillness and repose, occurring
mostly at noonday, and affecting one with a sensation of awful grandeur, by contrast with the
preceding disturbances, are followed, especially in the night, by a tumultuous roar from the
legions of contending animals.

  "A universal hubbub wild
  Of stunning sounds and voices all confused,
  Borne through the hollow dark, assaults the ear
  With loudest vehemence."

Even the notes of insects are a deafening crash, like the rattling of machinery in a cotton-mill.
Except in the hush of noonday, the notes of singing-birds are drowned amidst the howling of
monkeys, the whining of sapajous, the roar of the jaguar, and the dismal hooting of thousands
of wild animals that riot in these awful solitudes. The sight of the fairest flowers and the
most beautiful insects and birds only renders one more keenly sensitive to the frightful discords
that startle and the perils that surround him.

Similar contrasts are observed in the vegetation of this region, where the giant trees of the
forest are chained in the embraces of vines that contend with them for existence and finally
strangle them. Trees and other plants are crowded together so promiscuously, that Nature seems
to be striving to collect into one space every possible variety of species. Trees of the most
poisonous and deadly qualities grow side by side with the Bread-Fruit, the Cocoa-Nut, and the
beneficent Cinchona. Here are the poison and its antidote,--the monster tree and its miniature
epiphyte,--the plant that astonishes by its magnitude, and the one that delights us by its
minuteness. Here, if anywhere on the face of the earth, may we form some conception of the
state of our planet during the Eocene period, before the world had come under the dominion
of the human race.

But if Nature in this region has manifested an exuberance of animal and vegetable life, thereby
rendering her bounties almost unavailable to man, there are other parts in which she seems
to have provided for his particular benefit. In these favored regions, we find the Banana,
the Cocoa, and the Date Palm, and other special gifts of Providence to the inhabitants of the
equator. Palms are generally found only in small groups and plantations, but there are certain
species of this family which are associated in extensive woods, and constitute, in some respects,
one of the most charming descriptions of forest-scenery. The Dwarf Palms of the sub-tropical
regions are chiefly assembled in masses, of which the Palmetto of Florida and the Chaemerops
of the South of Europe are conspicuous examples. The true Palms are likewise sometimes associated
in forests, though not generally of a social habit. In one of the most celebrated of these,
at the mouth of the Orinoco, composed chiefly of the Mauritian Palms, the wild Guaranos have
established a national existence. Like monkeys, they live almost wholly in trees, having their
habitations supported either by wooden pillars or by a matting suspended from tree to tree.
In the wet season, when the ground is inundated, the inhabitants travel about their village
in canoes.

The beauty of a grove of Palms has been a favorite theme of travellers. Humboldt, who saw Nature
with the eye of a painter and the feelings of a poet, amidst all the dry details of science,
regards them as the most beautiful of vegetable productions. It has always seemed to me, however,
that travellers in general have been led to exaggerate the charms of Nature in the tropics,
by observing the remarkable beauty of a few individual objects. Their susceptibility to be
affected by the scenes presented to their view is likewise exalted by the confinement of their
voyage; they are enraptured with the novelty of everything about them, by the voluptuousness
of the climate and the abundance of delicious fruits, and always afterwards recur to the scenes
of their tropical visit with an excited imagination.

In countries near the equator, many plants which are herbs in our latitude assume arborescent
forms. Such are the Tree-Grasses, which form impenetrable forests, equalling some of the Fir
woods of the North in extent, if not in beauty and grandeur. In this part of the world we know
the Ferns only as a low herbaceous tribe of plants, consisting of mere fronds rising out of
the ground. We admire them for their beautifully compounded leaves, and their colors of red,
orange, and russet that variegate our meadows in June, their garlands of verdure upon the rocky
hills in winter, and the profusion of their frondage in the shady glens in summer. But in certain
parts of the equatorial zone the Ferns put off the humble guise in which they appear at the
North. They no longer associate with the lowly Violet, allowing themselves to be crowded by
the Hellebore and overtopped by the Meadow Rue; but they rear their branches aloft and assume
the dignity and stature of trees. Man, who looks down upon them in our own latitude, and tramples
them under his feet, looks in that region far above his head, and beholds their magnificent
fronds spread out like a great tent between him and the heavens.

Tree-Ferns, though confined principally to the equatorial zone, are unable to endure the heat
of the plains. They occupy an elevation that affords them the continual temperature of spring,
three thousand feet above the sea,--the region of the lowest stratum of clouds,--where they
receive the benefit of their moisture before it descends to the earth in showers. Humboldt
ranks them with the noblest forms of tropical vegetation,--less lofty than the Palms, but surpassing
them in beauty of foliage. The arborescent Ferns and Grasses are true specimens of those plants,
of simple organic structure, which are found in the fossil remains of the early geological
periods, and are the only plants now extant which may be considered the representatives of
that epoch, when the saurians and the mastodons held dominion over the earth, and before the
Angel of Light had descended from heaven to make preparation for a higher race of beings.

MISS LUCINDA.

But that Solomon is out of fashion I should quote him, here and now, to the effect that there
is a time for all things; but Solomon is obsolete, and never, no, never, will I dare to quote
a dead language, "for raisons I have," as the exiles of Erin say. Yet, in spite of Solomon
and Horace, I may express my own less concise opinion, that even in hard times, and dull times,
and war times, there is yet a little time to laugh, a brief hour to smile and love and pity,
just as through this dreary easterly storm, bringing clouds and rain, sobbing against casement
and door with the inarticulate wail of tempests, there comes now and then the soft shine of
a sun behind it all, a fleeting glitter, an evanescent aspect of what has been.

But if I apologize for a story that is nowise tragic, nor fitted to "the fashion of these times,"
possibly somebody will say at its end that I should also have apologized for its subject, since
it is as easy for an author to treat his readers to high themes as vulgar ones, and velvet
can be thrown into a portrait as cheaply as calico; but of this apology I wash my hands. I
believe nothing in place or circumstance makes romance. I have the same quick sympathy for
Biddy's sorrows with Patrick that I have for the Empress of France and her august, but rather
grim lord and master. I think words are often no harder to bear than "a blue bating," and I
have a reverence for poor old maids as great as for the nine Muses. Commonplace people are
only commonplace from character, and no position affects that. So forgive me once more, patient
reader, if I offer to you no tragedy in high life, no sentimental history of fashion and wealth,
but only a little story about a woman who could not be a heroine.

Miss Lucinda Jane Ann Manners was a lady of unknown age, who lived in a place I call Dalton,
in a State of these Disuniting States, which I do not mention for good cause. I have already
had so many unconscious personalities visited on my devoted head that but for lucidity I should
never mention persons or places, inconvenient as it would be. However, Miss Lucinda did live,
and lived by the aid of "means," which, in the vernacular, is money. Not a great deal, it is
true,--five thousand dollars at lawful interest, and a little wooden house, do not imply many
luxuries even to a single-woman; and it is also true that a little fine sewing taken in helped
Miss Manners to provide herself with a few small indulgences otherwise beyond her reach. She
had one or two idiosyncrasies, as they are politely called, that were her delight. Plenty of
dish-towels were necessary to her peace of mind; without five pair of scissors she could not
be happy; and Tricopherous was essential to her well-being: indeed, she often said she would
rather give up coffee than Tricopherous, for her hair was black and wiry and curly, and caps
she abhorred, so that of a winter's day her head presented the most irrelevant and volatile
aspect, each particular hair taking a twist on its own responsibility, and improvising a wild
halo about her unsaintly face, unless subdued into propriety by the aforesaid fluid.

I said Miss Lucinda's face was unsaintly,--I mean unlike ancient saints as depicted by contemporary
artists: modern and private saints are after another fashion. I met one yesterday, whose green
eyes, great nose, thick lips, and sallow wrinkles, under a bonnet of fifteen years' standing,
further clothed upon by a scant merino cloak and cat-skin tippet, would have cut a sorry figure
in the gallery of the Vatican or the Louvre, and put the tranquil Madonna of San Sisto into
a state of stunning antithesis; but if Saint Agnes or Saint Catharine was half as good as my
saint, I am glad of it!

No, there was nothing sublime and dolorous about Miss Manners; her face was round, cheery,
and slightly puckered, with two little black eyes sparking and shining under dark brows, a
nose she unblushingly called pug, and a big mouth with eminently white and regular teeth, which
she said were such a comfort, for they never ached, and never would to the end of time. Add
to this physiognomy a small and rather spare figure, dressed in the cleanest of calicoes, always
made in one style, and rigidly scorning hoops,--without a symptom of a collar, in whose place
(or it may be over which) she wore a white cambric handkerchief, knotted about her throat,
and the two ends brought into subjection by means of a little angular-headed gold pin, her
sole ornament, and a relic of her old father's days of widowhood, when buttons were precarious
tenures. So much for her aspect. Her character was even more quaint.

She was the daughter of a clergyman, one of the old school, the last whose breeches and knee-buckles
adorned the profession, who never "outlived his usefulness," nor lost his godly simplicity.
Parson Manners held rule over an obscure and quiet village in the wilds of Vermont, where hard-handed
farmers wrestled with rocks and forests for their daily bread, and looked forward to heaven
as a land of green pastures and still waters, where agriculture should be a pastime, and winter
impossible. Heavy freshets from the mountains that swelled their rushing brooks into annual
torrents, and snow-drifts that covered five-rail fences a foot above the posts and blocked
up the turnpike-road for weeks, caused this congregation fully to appreciate Parson Manners's
favorite hymns,--

  "There is a land of pure delight,"

and

  "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand."

Indeed, one irreverent, but "pretty smart feller," who lived on the top of a hill known as
Drift Hill, where certain adventurous farmers dwelt for the sake of its smooth sheep-pastures,
was heard to say, after a mighty sermon by Parson Manners about the seven-times heated furnaces
of judgment reserved for the wicked, that "Parson hadn't better try to skeer Drift-Hillers
with a hot place; 't wouldn't more 'n jest warm 'em through down there, arter a real snappin'
winter."

In this out-of-the-way nook was Lucinda Jane Ann born and bred. Her mother was like her in
many things,--just such a cheery, round-faced little body, but with no more mind than found
ample scope for itself in superintending the affairs of house and farm, and vigorously "seeing
to" her husband and child. So, while Mrs. Manners baked, and washed, and ironed, and sewed,
and knit, and set the sweetest example of quiet goodness and industry to all her flock, without
knowing she could set an example, or be followed as one, the Parson amused himself, between
sermons of powerful doctrine and parochial duties of a more human interest, with educating
Lucinda, whose intellect was more like his own than her mother's. A strange training it was
for a young girl,--mathematics, metaphysics, Latin, theology of the driest sort; and after
an utter failure at Greek and Hebrew, though she had toiled patiently through seven books of
the "Aeneid," Parson Manners mildly sniffed at the inferiority of the female mind, and betook
himself to teaching her French, which she learned rapidly, and spoke with a pure American accent,
perhaps as pleasing to a Parisian ear as the hiss of Piedmont or the gutturals of Switzerland.
Moreover, the minister had been brought up, himself, in the most scrupulous refinement of manner;
his mother was a widow, the last of an "old family," and her dainty, delicate observances were
inbred, as it were, in her only son. This sort of elegance is perhaps the most delicate test
of training and descent, and all these things Lucinda was taught from the grateful recollection
of a son who never forgot his mother, through all the solitary labors and studies of a long
life. So it came to pass, that, after her mother died, Lucinda grew more and more like her
father, and, as she became a woman, these rare refinements separated her more and more from
those about her, and made her necessarily solitary. As for marriage, the possibility of such
a thing never crossed her mind; there was not a man in the parish who did not offend her sense
of propriety and shock her taste, whenever she met one; and though her warm, kind heart made
her a blessing to the poor and sick, her mother was yet bitterly regretted at quiltings and
tea-drinkings, where she had been so "sociable-like."

It is rather unfortunate for such a position as Lucinda's, that, as Deacon Stowell one day
remarked to her father, "Natur' will be Natur' as much on Drift Hill as down to Bosting"; and
when she began to feel that "strong necessity of loving" that sooner or later assails every
woman's heart, there was nothing for it to overflow on, when her father had taken his share.
Now Lucinda loved the Parson most devoutly. Ever since the time when she could just remember
watching through the dusk his white stockings, as they glimmered across the road to evening-meeting,
and looked like a supernatural pair of legs taking a walk on their own responsibility, twilight
concealing the black breeches and coat from mortal view, Lucinda had regarded her father with
a certain pleasing awe. His long abstractions, his profound knowledge, his grave, benign manners,
and the thousand daily refinements of speech and act that seemed to put him far above the sphere
of his pastorate,--all these things inspired as much reverence as affection; and when she wished
with all her heart and soul she had a sister or a brother to tend and kiss and pet, it never
once occurred to her that any of those tender familiarities could be expended on her father:
she would as soon have thought of caressing any of the goodly angels whose stout legs, flowing
curls, and impossible draperies sprawled among the pictures in the big Bible, and who excited
her wonder as much by their garments as their turkey-wings and brandishing arms. So she betook
herself to pets, and growing up to the old-maidenhood of thirty-five before her father fell
asleep, was by that time the centre of a little world of her own,--hens, chickens, squirrels,
cats, dogs, lambs, and sundry transient guests of stranger kind; so that, when she left her
old home, and removed to the little house in Dalton that had been left her by her mother's
aunt, and had found her small property safely invested by means of an old friend of her father's,
Miss Manners made one more journey to Vermont to bring in safety to their future dwelling a
cat and three kittens, an old blind crow, a yellow dog of the true cur breed, and a rooster
with three hens, "real creepers," as she often said, "none of your long-legged, screaming creatures."

Lucinda missed her father, and mourned him as constantly and faithfully as ever a daughter
could; but her temperament was more cheerful and buoyant than his, and when once she was quietly
settled in her little house, her garden and her pets gave her such full occupation that she
sometimes blamed herself for not feeling more lonely and unhappy. A little longer life or a
little more experience would have taught her better: power to be happy is the last thing to
regret. Besides, it would have been hard to be cheerless in that sunny little house, with its
queer old furniture of three-legged tables, high-backed chairs, and chintz curtains where red
mandarins winked at blue pagodas on a deep-yellow ground, and birds of insane ornithology pecked
at insects that never could have been hatched, or perched themselves on blossoms totally unknown
to any mortal flora. Old engravings of Bartolozzi, from the stiff elegances of Angelica Kaufman
and the mythologies of Reynolds, adorned the shelf; and the carpet in the parlor was of veritable
English make, older than Lucinda herself, but as bright in its fading and as firm in its usefulness
as she. Up-stairs the tiny chambers were decked with spotless white dimity, and rush-bottomed
chairs stood in each window, with a strip of the same old carpet by either bedside; and in
the kitchen the blue settle that had stood by the Vermont fireside now defended this lesser
hearth from the draught of the door, and held under the seat thereof sundry ironing-sheets,
the blanket belonging to them, and good store of ticking and worsted holders. A half-gone set
of egg-shell china stood in the parlor-closet,--cups, and teapot, and sugar-bowl, rimmed with
brown and gold in a square pattern, and a shield without blazon on the side; the quaint tea-caddy
with its stopper stood over against the pursy little cream-pot, and held up in its lumps of
sparkling sugar the oddest sugar-tongs, also a family relic;--beside this, six small spoons,
three large ones, and a little silver porringer comprised all the "plate" belonging to Miss
Manners, so that no fear of burglars haunted her, and but for her pets she would have lived
a life of profound and monotonous tranquillity. But this was a vast exception; in her life
her pets were the great item now;--her cat had its own chair in the parlor and kitchen; her
dog, a rug and a basket never to be meddled with by man or beast; her old crow, its special
nest of flannel and cotton, where it feebly croaked as soon as Miss Lucinda began to spread
the little table for her meals; and the three kittens had their own playthings and their own
saucer as punctiliously as if they had been children. In fact, Miss Manners had a greater share
of kindness for beasts than for mankind. A strange compound of learning and unworldliness,
of queer simplicity, native penetration, and common sense, she had read enough books to despise
human nature as it develops itself in history and theology, and she had not known enough people
to love it in its personal development. She had a general idea that all men were liars, and
that she must be on her guard against their propensity to cheat and annoy a lonely and helpless
woman; for, to tell the truth, in her good father's over-anxiety to defend her from the snares
of evil men after his death, his teachings had given her opinion this bias, and he had forgotten
to tell her how kindly and how true he had found many of his own parishioners, how few inclined
to harm or pain him. So Miss Lucinda made her entrance into life at Dalton, distrustful, but
not suspicious; and after a few attempts on the part of the women who were her neighbors to
be friendly or intimate, they gave her up as impracticable: not because she was impolite or
unkind: they did not themselves know why they failed, though she could have told them; for,
old maid as she was, poor and plain and queer, she could not bring herself to associate familiarly
with people who put their teaspoons into the sugar-bowl, helped themselves with their own knives
and forks, gathered up bits of uneaten butter and returned them to the plate for next time,
or replaced on the dish pieces of cake half eaten or cut with the knives they had just introduced
into their mouths. Miss Lucinda's code of minor morals would have forbidden her to drink from
the same cup with a queen, and have considered a pitchfork as suitable as a knife to eat with,
nor would she have offered to a servant the least thing she had touched with her own lips or
her own implements of eating; and she was too delicately bred to look on in comfort where such
things were practised. Of course these women were not ladies; and though many of them had kind
hearts and warm impulses of goodness, yet that did not make up to her for their social misdemeanors,
and she drew herself more into her own little shell, and cared more for her garden and her
chickens, her cats and her dog, than for all the humanity of Dalton put together.

Miss Manners held her flowers next dearest to her pets, and treated them accordingly. Her garden
was the most brilliant bit of ground possible. It was big enough to hold one flourishing peach-tree,
one Siberian crab, and a solitary egg-plum; while under these fruitful boughs bloomed moss-roses
in profusion, of the dear old-fashioned kind, every deep pink bud with its clinging garment
of green breathing out the richest odor; close by, the real white rose, which fashion has banished
to country towns, unfolded its cups of pearl flushed with yellow sunrise to the heart; and
by its side its damask sister waved long sprays of bloom and perfume. Tulips, dark-purple and
cream-color, burning scarlet and deep-maroon, held their gay chalices up to catch the dew;
hyacinths, blue, white, and pink, hung heavy bells beneath them; spiced carnations of rose
and garnet crowded their bed in July and August, heart's-ease fringed the walks, May honeysuckles
clambered over the board-fence, and monthly honeysuckles overgrew the porch at the back-door,
making perpetual fragrance from their moth-like horns of crimson and ivory. Nothing inhabited
those beds that was not sweet and fair and old-fashioned. Gray-lavender-bushes sent up purple
spikes in the middle of the garden and were duly housed in winter, but these were the sole
tender plants admitted, and they pleaded their own cause in the breath of the linen-press and
the bureau-drawers that held Miss Lucinda's clothes. Beyond the flowers, utility blossomed
in a row of bean-poles, a hedge of currant-bushes against the farther fence, carefully tended
cauliflowers, and onions enough to tell of their use as sparing as their number; a few deep-red
beets and golden carrots were all the vegetables beside: Miss Lucinda never ate potatoes or pork.

Her housekeeping, but for her pets, would have been the proper housewifery for a fairy. Out
of her fruit she annually conserved miracles of flavor and transparence,--great plums like
those in Aladdin's garden, of shining topaz,--peaches tinged with the odorous bitter of their
pits, and clear as amber,--crimson crabs floating in their own ruby sirup, or transmuted into
jelly crystal clear, yet breaking with a grain,--and jelly from the acid currants to garnish
her dinner-table or refresh the fevered lips of a sick neighbor. It was a study to visit her
tiny pantry, where all these "lucent sirops" stood in tempting array,--where spices, and sugar,
and tea, in their small jars, flanked the sweetmeats, and a jar of glass showed its store of
whitest honey, and another stood filled with crisp cakes. Here always a loaf or two of home-made
bread lay rolled in a snowy cloth, and another was spread over a dish of butter; pies were
not in favor here,--nor milk, save for the cats; salt fish Miss Manners never could abide,--her
savory taste allowed only a bit of rich old cheese, or thin scraps of hung beef, with her bread
and butter; sauces and spices were few in her repertory, but she cooked as only a lady can
cook, and might have asked Soyer himself to dinner. For, verily, after much meditation and
experience, I have divined that it takes as much sense and refinement and talent to cook a
dinner, wash and wipe a dish, make a bed as it should be made, and dust a room as it should
be dusted, as goes to the writing of a novel or shining in high society.

But because Miss Lucinda Manners was reserved and "unsociable," as the neighbors pronounced
her, I did not, therefore, mean to imply that she was inhuman. No neighbor of hers, local or
Scriptural, fell ill, without an immediate offer of aid from her: she made the best gruel known
to Dalton invalids, sent the ripest fruit and the sweetest flowers; and if she could not watch
with the sick, because it interfered with her duties at home in an unpleasant and inconvenient
way, she would sit with them hour after hour in the day-time, and wait on all their caprices
with the patient tenderness of a mother. Children she always eyed with strange wistfulness,
as if she longed to kiss them, but didn't know how; yet no child was ever invited across her
threshold, for the yellow cur hated to be played with, and children always torment kittens.

So Miss Lucinda wore on happily toward the farther side of the middle Ages. One after another
of her pets passed away and was replaced, the yellow cur barked his last currish signal, the
cat died and her kittens came to various ends of time or casualty, the crow fell away to dust
and was too old to stuff, and the garden bloomed and faded ten times over, before Miss Manners
found herself to be forty-six years old, which she heroically acknowledged one fine day to
the census-taker. But it was not this consciousness, nor its confession, that drew the dark
brows so low over Miss Lucinda's eyes that day; it was quite another trouble, and one that
wore heavily on her mind, as we shall proceed to explain. For Miss Manners, being, like all
the rest of her sex, quite unable to do without some masculine help, had employed, for some
seven years, an old man by the name of Israel Slater, to do her "chores," as the vernacular
hath it. It is a mortifying thing, and one that strikes at the roots of Women's Rights terribly
sharp blows, but I must even own it, that one might as well try to live without one's bread-and-butter
as without the aid of the dominant sex. When I see women split wood, unload coal-carts, move
wash-tubs, and roll barrels of flour and apples handily down cellar-ways or up into carts,
then I shall believe in the sublime theories of the strong-minded sisters; but as long as I
see before me my own forlorn little hands, and sit down on the top stair to recover breath,
and try in vain to lift the water-pitcher at table, just so long I shall be glad and thankful
that there are men in the world, and that half a dozen of them are my kindest and best friends.
It was rather an affliction to Miss Lucinda to feel this innate dependence, and at first she
resolved to employ only small boys, and never any one of them more than a week or two. She
had an unshaped theory that an old maid was a match for a small boy, but that a man would cheat
and domineer over her. Experience sadly put to flight these notions for a succession of boys
in this cabinet-ministry for the first three years of her stay in Dalton would have driven
her into a Presbyterian convent, had there been one at hand. Boy Number One caught the yellow
cur out of bounds one day, and shaved his plumy tail to a bare stick, and Miss Lucinda fairly
shed tears of grief and rage when Pink appeared at the door with the denuded appendage tucked
between his little legs, and his funny yellow eyes casting sidelong looks of apprehension at
his mistress. Boy Number One was despatched directly. Number Two did pretty well for a month,
but his integrity and his appetite conflicted, and Miss Lucinda found him one moonlight night
perched in her plum-tree devouring the half-ripe fruit. She shook him down with as little ceremony
as if he had been an apple; and though he lay at Death's door for a week with resulting cholera-morbus,
she relented not. So the experiment went on, till a list of casualties that numbered in it
fatal accidents to three kittens, two hens and a rooster, and at last Pink himself, who was
pent into a decline by repeated drenchings from the watering-pot, put an end to her forbearance,
and she instituted in her viziership the old man who had now kept his office so long,--a queer,
withered, slow, humorous old creature, who did "chores" for some six or seven other households,
and got a living by sundry "jobs" of wood-sawing, hoeing corn, and other like works of labor,
if not of skill. Israel was a great comfort to Miss Lucinda: he was efficient counsel in the
maladies of all her pets, had a sovereign cure for the gapes in chickens, and could stop a
cat's fit with the greatest ease; he kept the tiny garden in perfect order, and was very honest,
and Miss Manners favored him accordingly. She compounded liniment for his rheumatism, herb-sirup
for his colds, presented him with a set of flannel shirts, and knit him a comforter; so that
Israel expressed himself strongly in favor of "Miss Lucindy," and she said to herself he really
was "quite good for a man."

But just now, in her forty-seventh year, Miss Lucinda had come to grief, and all on account
of Israel and his attempts to please her. About six months before this census-taking era, the
old man had stepped into Miss Manners's kitchen with an unusual radiance on his wrinkles and
in his eyes, and began without his usual morning greeting,--

"I've got so'thin' for you naow, Miss Lucindy. You're a master-hand for pets, but I'll bet
a red cent you ha'n't an idee what I've got for ye naow!"

"I'm sure I can't tell, Israel," said she; "you'll have to let me see it."

"Well," said he, lifting up his coat and looking carefully behind him as he sat down on the
settle, lest a stray kitten or chicken should preoccupy the bench, "you see I was down to Orrin's
abaout a week back, and he hed a litter o' pigs,--eleven on 'em. Well, he couldn't raise the
hull on 'em,--'t a'n't good to raise more 'n nine,--an' so he said, ef I'd 'a' had a place
o' my own, I could 'a' had one on 'em, but, as't was, he guessed he'd hev to send one to market
for a roaster. I went daown to the barn to see 'em, an' there was one, the cutest little critter
I ever sot eyes on, and I've seen more 'n four pigs in my day,--'t was a little black-spotted
one, as spry as an ant, and the dreffullest knowin' look out of its eyes! I fellowshipped it
right off, and I said, says I, 'Orrin, ef you'll let me hev that 'ere little spotted feller,
I'll git a place for him, for I do take to him consarnedly.' So he said I could, and I fetched
him hum, and Miss Slater and me we kinder fed him up for a few days back, till he got sorter
wonted, and I'm a-goin' to fetch him to you."

"But, Israel, I haven't any place to put him in."

"Well, that a'n't nothin' to hender. I'll jest fetch out them old boards out of the wood-shed,
and knock up a little sty right off, daown by the end o' the shed, and you ken keep your swill
that I've hed before, and it'll come handy."

"But pigs are so dirty!"

"I don't know as they be; they ha'n't no great conveniences for washin' ginerally; but I never
heerd as they was dirtier 'n other critters, where they run wild. An' beside, that a'n't goin'
to hender, nuther; I calculate to make it one o' the chores to take keer of him; 't won't cost
no more to you; and I ha'n't no great opportunities to do things for folks that 's allers a-doin'
for me; so't you needn't be afeard, Miss Lucindy: I love to."

Miss Lucinda's heart got the better of her judgment. A nature that could feel so tenderly for
its inferiors in the scale could not be deaf to the tiny voices of humanity, when they reached
her solitude; and she thanked Israel for the pig so heartily that the old man's face brightened
still more, and his voice softened from its cracked harshness, as he said, clicking up and
down the latch of the back-door,--

"Well, I'm sure you're as welcome as you are obleeged, and I'll knock up that 'ere pen right
off; he sha'n't pester ye any,--that's a fact."

Strange to say,--yet perhaps it might have been expected from her proclivities,--Miss Lucinda
took an astonishing fancy to the pig. Very few people know how intelligent an animal a pig
is; but when one is regarded merely as pork and hams, one's intellect is apt to fall into neglect:
a moral sentiment which applies out of Pigdom. This creature would not have passed muster at
a county fair; no Suffolk blood compacted and rounded him; he belonged to the "racers," and
skipped about his pen with the alacrity of a large flea, wiggling his curly tail as expressively
as a dog's, and "all but speakin'," as Israel said. He was always glad to see Miss Lucinda,
and established a firm friendship with her dog Fun, a pretty, sentimental, German spaniel.
Besides, he kept tolerably clean by dint of Israel's care, and thrust his long nose between
the rails of his pen for grass, or fruit, or carrot- and beet-tops, with a knowing look out
of his deep-set eyes that was never to be resisted by the soft-hearted spinster. Indeed, Miss
Lucinda enjoyed the possession of one pet who could not tyrannize over her. Pink's place was
more than filled by Fun, who was so oppressively affectionate that he never could leave his
mistress alone. If she lay down on her bed, he leaped up and unlatched the door, and stretched
himself on the white counterpane beside her with a grunt of satisfaction; if she sat down to
knit or sew, he laid his head and shoulders across her lap, or curled himself up on her knees;
if she was cooking, he whined and coaxed round her till she hardly knew whether she fried or
broiled her steak; and if she turned him out and buttoned the door, his cries were so pitiful
she could never be resolute enough to keep him in exile five minutes,--for it was a prominent
article in her creed, that animals have feelings that are easily wounded, and are of "like
passions" with men, only incapable of expression.

Indeed, Miss Lucinda considered it the duty of human beings to atone to animals for the Lord's
injustice in making them dumb and four-legged. She would have been rather startled at such
an enunciation of her practice, but she was devoted to it as a practice: she would give her
own chair to the cat and sit on the settle herself; get up at midnight, if a mew or a bark
called her, though the thermometer was below zero; The tenderloin of her steak or the liver
of her chicken was saved for a pining kitten or an ancient and toothless cat; and no disease
or wound daunted her faithful nursing, or disgusted her devoted tenderness. It was rather hard
on humanity, and rather reversive of Providence, that all this care and pains should be lavished
on cats and dogs, while little morsels of flesh and blood, ragged, hungry, and immortal, wandered
up and down the streets. Perhaps that they were immortal was their defence from Miss Lucinda;
one might have hoped that her "other-worldliness" accepted that fact as enough to outweigh
present pangs, if she had not openly declared, to Israel Slater's immense amusement and astonishment,
that she believed creatures had souls,--little ones perhaps, but souls after all, and she did
expect to see Pink again some time or other.

"Well, I hope he's got his tail feathered out ag'in," said Israel, dryly. "I do'no' but what
hair'd grow as well as feathers in a sperctooal state, and I never see a pictur' of an angel
but what hed consider'ble many feathers."

Miss Lucinda looked rather confounded. But humanity had one little revenge on her in the shape
of her cat, a beautiful Maltese, with great yellow eyes, fur as soft as velvet, and silvery
paws as lovely to look at as they were thistly to touch. Toby certainly pleaded hard for Miss
Lucinda's theory of a soul; but his was no good one: some tricksy and malign little spirit
had lent him his share of intellect, and he used it to the entire subjugation of Miss Lucinda.
When he was hungry, he was as well-mannered and as amiable as a good child,--he would coax,
and purr, and lick her fingers with his pretty red tongue, like a "perfect love"; but when
he had his fill, and needed no more, then came Miss Lucinda's time of torment. If she attempted
to caress him, he bit and scratched like a young tiger, he sprang at her from the floor and
fastened on her arm with real fury; if he cried at the window and was not directly let in,
as soon as he had achieved entrance his first manoeuvre was to dash at her ankles and bite
them, if he could, as punishment for her tardiness. This skirmishing was his favorite mode
of attack; if he was turned out of the closet, or off the pillow up-stairs, he retreated under
the bed and made frantic sallies at her feet, till the poor woman got actually nervous, and
if he was in the room made a flying leap as far as she could to her bed, to escape those keen
claws. Indeed, old Israel found her more than once sitting in the middle of the kitchen-floor
with Toby crouched for a spring under the table, his poor mistress afraid to move, for fear
of her unlucky ankles. And this literally cat-ridden woman was hazed about and ruled over by
her feline tyrant to that extent that he occupied the easiest chair, the softest cushion, the
middle of the bed, and the front of the fire, not only undisturbed, but caressed. This is a
veritable history, beloved reader, and I offer it as a warning and an example: if you will
be an old maid, or if you can't help it, take to petting children, or donkeys, or even a respectable
cow, but beware of domestic tyranny in any shape but man's!

No wonder Miss Lucinda took kindly to the pig, who had a house of his own, and a servant, as
it were, to the avoidance of all trouble on her part,--the pig who capered for joy when she
or Fun approached, and had so much expression in his physiognomy that one almost expected to
see him smile. Many a sympathizing conference Miss Lucinda held with Israel over the perfections
of Piggy, as he leaned against the sty and looked over at his favorite after this last chore
was accomplished.

"I say for 't," exclaimed the old man, one day, "I b'lieve that cre'tur' knows enough to be
professor in a college. Why, he talks! he re'lly doos: a leetle through his nose, maybe, but
no more 'n Dr. Colton allers does,--'n' I declare he appears to have abaout as much sense.
I never see the equal of him. I thought he'd 'a larfed right out yesterday, when I gin him
that mess o' corn: he got up onto his forelegs on the trough, an' he winked them knowin' eyes
o' his'n, an' waggled his tail, an' then he set off an' capered round till he come bunt up
ag'inst the boards. I tell you,--that sorter sobered him; he gin a growlin' grunt, an' shook
his ears, an' looked sideways at me, and then he put to and eet up that corn as sober as a
judge. I swan! he doos beat the Dutch!"

But there was one calculation forgotten both by Miss Lucinda and Israel: the pig would grow,--and
in consequence, as I said before, Miss Lucinda came to grief; for when the census-taker tinkled
her sharp little door-bell, it called her from a laborious occupation at the sty,--no more
and no less than trying to nail up a board that Piggy had torn down in struggling to get out
of his durance. He had grown so large that Miss Lucinda was afraid of him; his long legs and
their vivacious motion added to the shrewd intelligence of his eyes, and his nose seemed as
formidable to this poor little woman as the tusk of a rhinoceros: but what should she do with
him? One might as well have proposed to her to kill and cut up Israel as to consign Piggy to
the "fate of race." She could not turn him into the street to starve, for she loved him; and
the old maid suffered from a constancy that might have made some good man happy, but only embarrassed
her with the pig. She could not keep him forever,--that was evident; she knew enough to be
aware that time would increase his disabilities as a pet, and he was an expensive one now,--for
the corn-swallowing capacities of a pig, one of the "racer" breed, are almost incredible, and
nothing about Miss Lucinda wanted for food even to fatness. Besides, he was getting too big
for his pen, and so "cute" an animal could not be debarred from all out-door pleasures, and
tantalized by the sight of a green and growing garden before his eyes continually, without
making an effort to partake of its delights. So, when Miss Lucinda indued herself with her
brown linen sack and sun-bonnet to go and weed her carrot-patch, she was arrested on the way
by a loud grunting and scrambling in Piggy's quarter, and found to her distress that he had
contrived to knock off the upper board from his pen. She had no hammer at hand; so she seized
a large stone that lay near by and pounded at the board till the twice-tinkling bell recalled
her to the house, and as soon as she had made confession to the census-taker she went back,--alas,
too late! Piggy had redoubled his efforts, another board had yielded, and he was free! What
a thing freedom is! how objectionable in practice, how splendid in theory! More people than
Miss Lucinda have been put to their wits' end when "Hoggie" burst his bonds and became rampant
instead of couchant. But he enjoyed it; he made the tour of the garden on a delightful canter,
brandishing his tail with an air of defiance that daunted his mistress at once, and regarding
her with his small bright eyes as if he would before long taste her and see if she was as crisp
as she looked. She retreated forthwith to the shed and caught up a broom with which she courageously
charged upon Piggy, and was routed entirely; for, being no way alarmed by her demonstration,
the creature capered directly at her, knocked her down, knocked the broom out of her hand,
and capered away again to the young carrot-patch.

"Oh, dear!" said Miss Manners, gathering herself up from the ground,--"if there only was a
man here!"

Suddenly she betook herself to her heels,--for the animal looked at her, and stopped eating:
that was enough to drive Miss Lucinda off the field. And now, quite desperate, she rushed through
the house and out of the front-door, actually in search of a man! Just down the street she
saw one. Had she been composed, she might have noticed the threadbare cleanliness of his dress,
the odd cap that crowned his iron-gray locks, and the peculiar manner of his walk; for our
little old maid had stumbled upon no less a person than Monsieur Jean Leclerc, the dancing-master
of Dalton. Not that this accomplishment was much in vogue in the embryo city; but still there
were a few who liked to fit themselves for firemen's balls and sleighing-party frolics, and
quite a large class of children were learning betimes such graces as children in New England
receive more easily than their elders. Monsieur Leclerc had just enough scholars to keep his
coat threadbare and restrict him to necessities; but he lived, and was independent. All this
Miss Lucinda was ignorant of; she only saw a man, and, with the instinct of the sex in trouble
or danger, she appealed to him at once.

"Oh, Sir! won't you step in and help me? My pig has got out, and I can't catch him, and he
is ruining my garden!"

"Madame, I shall!" replied the Frenchman, bowing low, and assuming the first position.

So Monsieur Leclerc followed Miss Manners, and supplied himself with a mop that was hanging
in the shed as his best weapon. Dire was the battle between the pig and the Frenchman. They
skipped past each other and back again as if they were practising for a cotillon. Piggy had
four legs, which gave him a certain advantage; but the Frenchman had most brain, and in the
long run brain gets the better of legs. A weary dance they led each other, but after a while
the pet was hemmed in a corner, and Miss Lucinda had run for a rope to tie him, when, just
as she returned, the beast made a desperate charge, upset his opponent, and giving a leap in
the wrong direction, to his manifest astonishment, landed in his own sty! Miss Lucinda's courage
rose; she forgot her prostrate friend in need, and, running to the pen, caught up hammer and
nail-box on her way, and, with unusual energy, nailed up the bars stronger than ever, and then
bethought herself to thank the stranger. But there he lay quite still and pale.

"Dear me!" said Miss Manners, "I hope you haven't hurt yourself, Sir?"

"I have fear that I am hurt, Madame," said he, trying to smile. "I cannot to move but it pains me."

"Where is it? Is it your leg or your arm? Try and move one at a time," said Miss Lucinda, promptly.

The left leg was helpless, it could not answer to the effort, and the stranger lay back on
the ground pale with the pain. Miss Lucinda took her lavender-bottle out of her pocket and
softly bathed his head and face; then she took off her sack and folded it up under his head,
and put the lavender beside him. She was good at an emergency, and she showed it.

"You must lie quite still," said she; "you must not try to move till I come back with help,
or your leg will be hurt more."

With that she went away, and presently returned with two strong men and the long shutter of
a shop-window. To this extempore litter she carefully moved the Frenchman, and then her neighbors
lifted him and carried him into the parlor, where Miss Lucinda's chintz lounge was already
spread with a tight-pinned sheet to receive the poor man, and while her helpers put him to
bed she put on her bonnet and ran for the doctor.

Doctor Colton did his best for his patient, but pronounced it an impossibility to remove him
till the bone should be joined firmly, as a thorough cure was all-essential to his professional
prospects. And now, indeed, Miss Lucinda had her hands full. A nurse could not be afforded,
but Monsieur Leclerc was added to the list of old Israel's "chores," and what other nursing
he needed Miss Lucinda was glad to do; for her kind heart was full of self-reproaches to think
it was her pig that had knocked down the poor man, and her mop-handle that had twisted itself
across and under his leg, and aided, if not caused, its breakage. So Israel came in four or
five times a day to do what he could, and Miss Lucinda played nurse at other times to the best
of her ability. Such flavorous gruels and porridges as she concocted! such tisanes after her
guest's instructions! such dainty soups, and sweetbreads, and cutlets, served with such neatness!
After his experience of a second-rate boarding-house, Monsieur Leclerc thought himself in a
gastronomic paradise. Moreover, these tiny meals were garnished with flowers, which his French
taste for color and decoration appreciated: two or three stems of lilies-of-the-valley in their
folded green leaves, cool and fragrant; a moss-rosebud and a spire of purple-gray lavender
bound together with ribbon-grass; or three carnations set in glittering myrtle-sprays, the
last acquisition of the garden.

Miss Lucinda enjoyed nursing thoroughly, and a kindlier patient no woman ever had. Her bright
needle flew faster than ever through the cold linen and flaccid cambric of the shirts and cravats
she fashioned, while he told her, in his odd idioms, stories of his life in France, and the
curious customs both of society and cuisinerie, with which last he showed a surprising acquaintance.
Truth to tell, when Monsieur Leclerc said he had been a member of the Duc de Montmorenci's
household, he withheld the other half of this truth,--that he had been his valet-de-chambre:
but it was an hereditary service, and seemed to him as different a thing from common servitude
as a peer's office in the bedchamber differs from a lackey's. Indeed, Monsieur Leclerc was
a gentleman in his own way,--not of blood, but of breeding; and while he had faithfully served
the "aristocrats," as his father had done before him, he did not limit that service to their
prosperity, but in their greatest need descended to menial offices, and forgot that he could
dance and ride and fence almost as well as his young master. But a bullet from a barricade
put an end to his duty there, and he hated utterly the democratic rule that had overturned
for him both past and future, so he escaped, and came to America, the grand resort of refugees,
where he had labored, as he best knew how, for his own support, and kept to himself his disgust
at the manners and customs of the barbarians. Now, for the first time, he was at home and happy.
Miss Lucinda's delicate fashions suited him exactly; he adored her taste for the beautiful,
which she was unconscious of; he enjoyed her cookery, and though he groaned within himself
at the amount of debt he was incurring, yet he took courage from her kindness to believe she
would not be a hard creditor, and, being naturally cheerful, put aside his anxieties and amused
himself as well as her with his stories, his quavering songs, his recipes for pot-au-feu, tísane,
and pâtés, at once economical and savory. Never had a leg of lamb or a piece of roast beef
gone so far in her domestic experience, a chicken seemed almost to outlive its usefulness in
its various forms of reappearance, and the salads he devised were as wonderful as the omelets
he superintended, or the gay dances he played on his beloved violin, as soon as he could sit
up enough to manage it. Moreover,--I should say mostover, if the word were admissible,--Monsieur
Leclerc lifted a great weight before long from Miss Lucinda's mind. He began by subduing Fun
to his proper place by a mild determination that completely won the dog's heart. "Women and
spaniels," the world knows, "like kicking"; and though kicks were no part of the good man's
Rareyfaction of Fun, he certainly used a certain amount of coercion, and the dog's lawful owner
admired the skill of the teacher and enjoyed the better manners of the pupil thoroughly; she
could do twice as much sewing now, and never were her nights disturbed by a bark, for the dog
crouched by his new friend's bed in the parlor and lay quiet there. Toby was next undertaken,
and proved less amenable to discipline; he stood in some slight awe of the man who tried to
teach him, but still continued to sally out at Miss Lucinda's feet, to spring at her caressing
hand when he felt ill-humored, and to claw Fun's patient nose and his approaching paws when
his misplaced sentimentality led him to caress the cat; but after a while a few well-timed
slaps administered with vigor cured Toby of his worst tricks, though every blow made Miss Lucinda
wince, and almost shook her good opinion of Monsieur Leclerc: for in these long weeks he had
wrought out a good opinion of himself in her mind, much to her own surprise; she could not
have believed a man could be so polite, so gentle, so patient, and above all so capable of
ruling without tyranny. Miss Lucinda was puzzled.

One day, as Monsieur Leclerc was getting better, just able to go about on crutches, Israel
came into the kitchen, and Miss Manners went out to see him. She left the door open, and along
with the odor of a pot of raspberry-jam scalding over the fire, sending its steams of leaf-
and insect-fragrance through the little house, there came in also the following conversation.

"Israel," said Miss Lucinda, in a hesitating and rather forlorn tone, "I have been thinking,--I
don't know what to do with Piggy. He is quite too big for me to keep. I'm afraid of him, if
he gets out; and he eats up the garden."

"Well, that is a consider'ble swaller for a pig, Miss Lucindy; but I b'lieve you're abaout
right abaout keepin' on him. He is too big,--that's a fact; but he's so like a human cre'tur',
I'd jest abaout as lieves slarter Orrin. I declare, I don't know no more 'n a taown-haouse
goose what to do with him!"

"If I gave him away, I suppose he would be fatted and killed, of course?"

"I guess he'd be killed, likely; but as for fattenin' on him, I'd jest as soon undertake to
fatten a salt codfish. He's one o' the racers, an' they're as holler as hogsheads: you can
fill 'em up to their noses, ef you're a mind to spend your corn, and they'll caper it all off
their bones in twenty-four haours. I b'lieve, ef they was tied neck an' heels an' stuffed,
they'd wiggle thin betwixt feedin'-times. Why, Orrin, he raised nine on 'em, and every darned
critter's as poor as Job's turkey, to-day: they a'n't no good. I'd as lieves ha' had nine chestnut
rails,--an' a little lieveser, 'cause they don't eat nothin'."

"You don't know of any poor person who'd like to have a pig, do you?" said Miss Lucinda, wistfully.

"Well, the poorer they was, the quicker they'd eat him up, I guess,--ef they could eat such
a razor-back."

"Oh, I don't like to think of his being eaten! I wish he could be got rid of some other way.
Don't you think he might be killed in his sleep, Israel?"

This was a little too much for Israel. An irresistible flicker of laughter twitched his wrinkles
and bubbled in his throat.

"I think it's likely 'twould wake him up," said he, demurely. "Killin's killin', and a cre'tur'
can't sleep over it 's though 't was the stomach-ache. I guess he'd kick some, ef he was asleep,--and
screech some, too!"

"Dear me!" said Miss Lucinda, horrified at the idea. "I wish he could be sent out to run in
the woods. Are there any good woods near here, Israel?"

"I don't know but what he'd as lieves be slartered to once as to starve, an' be hunted down
out in the lots. Besides, there a'n't nobody as I knows of would like a hog to be a-rootin'
round amongst their turnips and young wheat."

"Well, what I shall do with him I don't know!" despairingly exclaimed Miss Lucinda. "He was
such a dear little thing when you brought him, Israel! Do you remember how pink his pretty
little nose was,--just like a rosebud,--and how bright his eyes looked, and his cunning legs?
And now he's grown so big and fierce! But I can't help liking him, either."

"He's a cute critter, that's sartain; but he does too much rootin' to have a pink nose now,
I expect;--there's consider'ble on't, so I guess it looks as well to have it gray. But I don't
know no more 'n you do what to do abaout it."

"If I could only get rid of him without knowing what became of him!" exclaimed Miss Lucinda,
squeezing her forefinger with great earnestness, and looking both puzzled and pained.

"If Mees Lucinda would pairmit?" said a voice behind her.

She turned round to see Monsieur Leclerc on his crutches, just in the parlor-door.

"I shall, Mees, myself dispose of Piggee, if it please. I can. I shall have no sound; he shall
to go away like a silent snow, to trouble you no more, never!"

"Oh, Sir! if you could! But I don't see how!"

"If Mees was to see, it would not be to save her pain. I shall have him to go by magique to
fiery land."

Fairy-land, probably! But Miss Lucinda did not perceive the équivoque.

"Nor yet shall I trouble Meester Israyel. I shall have the aid of myself and one good friend
that I have; and some night when you rise of the morning, he shall not be there."

Miss Lucinda breathed a deep sigh of relief.

"I am greatly obliged,--I shall be, I mean," said she.

"Well, I'm glad enough to wash my hands on't," said Israel. "I shall hanker arter the critter
some, but he's a-gettin' too big to be handy; 'n' it's one comfort abaout critters, you ken
get rid on 'em somehaow when they're more plague than profit. But folks has got to be let alone,
excep' the Lord takes 'em; an' He don't allers see fit."

What added point and weight to these final remarks of old Israel was the well-known fact that
he suffered at home from the most pecking and worrying of wives, and had been heard to say
in some moment of unusual frankness that he "didn't see how't could be sinful to wish Miss
Slater was in heaven, for she'd be lots better off, and other folks too!"

Miss Lucinda never knew what befell her pig one fine September night; she did not even guess
that a visit paid to Monsieur by one of his pupils, a farmer's daughter just out of Dalton,
had anything to do with this enlèvement; she was sound asleep in her bed up-stairs, when her
guest shod his crutches with old gloves, and limped out to the garden-gate by dawn, where he
and the farmer tolled the animal out of his sty and far down the street by tempting red apples,
and then Farmer Steele took possession of him, and he was seen no more. No, the first thing
Miss Lucinda knew of her riddance was when Israel put his head into the back-door that same
morning, some four hours afterward, and said, with a significant nod,--

"He's gone!"

After all his other chores were done, Israel had a conference with Monsieur Leclerc, and the
two sallied into the garden, and in an hour had dismantled the low dwelling, cleared away the
wreck, levelled and smoothed its site, and Monsieur, having previously provided himself with
an Isabella-grape-vine, planted it on this forsaken spot, and trained it carefully against
the end of the shed: strange to say, though it was against all precedent to transplant a grape
in September, it lived and flourished. Miss Lucinda's gratitude to Monsieur Leclerc was altogether
disproportioned, as he thought, to his slight service. He could not understand fully her devotion
to her pets, but he respected it, and aided it whenever he could, though he never surmised
the motive that adorned Miss Lucinda's table with such delicate superabundance after the late
departure, and laid bundles of lavender-flowers in his tiny portmanteau till the very leather
seemed to gather fragrance.

Before long, Monsieur Leclerc was well enough to resume his classes, and return to his boarding-house;
but the latter was filled, and only offered a prospect of vacancy in some three weeks after
his application; so he returned home somewhat dejected, and as he sat by the little parlor-fire
after tea, he said to his hostess, in a reluctant tone,--

"Mees Lucinda, you have been of the kindest to the poor alien. I have it in my mind to relieve
you of this care very rapidly, but it is not in the Fates that I do. I have gone to my house
of lodgings, and they cannot to give me a chamber as yet I have fear that I must yet rely me
on your goodness for some time more, if you can to entertain me so much more of time?"

"Why, I shall like to, Sir," replied the kindly, simple-hearted old maid. "I'm sure you are
not a mite of trouble, and I never can forget what you did for my pig."

A smile flitted across the Frenchman's thin, dark face, and he watched her glittering needles
a few minutes in silence before he spoke again.

"But I have other things to say of the most unpleasant to me, Mees Lucinda. I have a great
debt for the goodness and care you to me have lavished. To the angels of the good God we must
submit to be debtors, but there are also of mortal obligations. I have lodged in your mansion
for more of ten weeks, and to you I pay yet no silver, but it is that I have it not at present--I
must ask of your goodness to wait."

The old maid's shining black eyes grew soft as she looked at him.

"Why!" said she, "I don't think you owe me much of anything, Mr. Leclerc. I never knew things
last as they have since you came. I really think you brought a blessing. I wish you would please
to think you don't owe me anything."

The Frenchman's great brown eyes shone with suspicious dew.

"I cannot to forget that I owe to you far more than any silver of man repays; but I should
not think to forget that I also owe to you silver, or I should not be worthy of a man's name.
No, Mees! I have two hands and legs. I will not let a woman most solitary spend for me her
good self."

"Well," said Miss Lucinda, "if you will be uneasy till you pay me, I would rather have another
kind of pay than money. I should like to know how to dance. I never did learn, when I was a
girl, and I think it would be good exercise."

Miss Lucinda supported this pious fiction through with a simplicity that quite deceived the
Frenchman. He did not think it so incongruous as it was. He had seen women of sixty, rouged,
and jewelled, and furbelowed, foot it deftly in the halls of the Faubourg St. Germain in his
earliest youth; and this cheery, healthy woman, with lingering blooms on either cheek, and
uncapped head of curly black hair but slightly strewn with silver, seemed quite as fit a subject
for the accomplishment. Besides, he was poor,--and this offered so easy a way of paying the
debt he had so dreaded! Well said Solomon,--"The destruction of the poor is their poverty!"
For whose moral sense, delicate sensitivenesses, generous longings, will not sometimes give
way to the stringent need of food and clothing, the gall of indebtedness, and the sinking consciousness
of an empty purse and threatening possibilities?

Monsieur Leclerc's face brightened.

"Ah! with what grand pleasure shall I teach you the dance!"

But it fell dark again as he proceeded,--

"Though not one, nor two, nor three, nor four quarters shall be of value sufficient to achieve
my payment."

"Then, if that troubles you, why, I should like to take some French lessons in the evening,
when you don't have classes. I learned French when I was quite a girl, but not to speak it
very easily; and if I could get some practice and the right way to speak, I should be glad."

"And I shall give you the real Parisien tone, Mees Lucinda!" said he, proudly. "I shall be
as if it were no more an exile when I repeat my tongue to you!"

And so it was settled. Why Miss Lucinda should learn French any more than dancing was not a
question in Monsieur Leclerc's mind. It is true, that Chaldaic would, in all probability, be
as useful to our friend as French; and the flying over poles and hanging by toes and fingers,
so eloquently described by the Apostle of the Body in these "Atlantic" pages, would have been
as well adapted to her style and capacity as dancing;--but his own language, and his own profession!
what man would not have regarded these as indispensable to improvement, particularly when they
paid his board?

During the latter three weeks of Monsieur Leclerc's stay with Miss Lucinda he made himself
surprisingly useful. He listed the doors against approaching winter breezes,--he weeded in
the garden,--trimmed, tied, trained, wherever either good office was needed,--mended china
with an infallible cement, and rickety chairs with the skill of a cabinet-maker; and whatever
hard or dirty work he did, he always presented himself at table in a state of scrupulous neatness:
his long brown hands showed no trace of labor; his iron-gray hair was reduced to smoothest
order; his coat speckless, if threadbare; and he ate like a gentleman, an accomplishment not
always to be found in the "best society," as the phrase goes,--whether the best in fact ever
lacks it is another thing. Miss Lucinda appreciated these traits,--they set her at ease; and
a pleasanter home-life could scarce be painted than now enlivened the little wooden house.
But three weeks pass away rapidly; and when the rusty portmanteau was gone from her spare chamber,
and the well-worn boots from the kitchen-corner, and the hat from its nail, Miss Lucinda began
to find herself wonderfully lonely. She missed the armfuls of wood in her wood-box, that she
had to fill laboriously, two sticks at a time; she missed the other plate at her tiny round
table, the other chair beside her fire; she missed that dark, thin, sensitive face, with its
rare and sweet smile; she wanted her story-teller, her yarn-winder, her protector, back again.
Good gracious! to think of an old lady of forty-seven entertaining such sentiments for a man!

Presently the dancing-lessons commenced. It was thought advisable that Miss Manners should
enter a class, and, in the fervency of her good intentions, she did not demur. But gratitude
and respect had to strangle with persistent hands the little serpents of the ridiculous in
Monsieur Leclerc's soul, when he beheld his pupil's first appearance. What reason was it, O
rose of seventeen, adorning thyself with cloudy films of lace and sparks of jewelry before
the mirror that reflects youth and beauty, that made Miss Lucinda array herself in a brand-new
dress of yellow muslin-de-laine strewed with round green spots, and displace her customary
hand-kerchief for a huge tamboured collar, on this eventful occasion? Why, oh, why did she
tie up the roots of her black hair with an unconcealable scarlet string? And most of all, why
was her dress so short, her slipper-strings so big and broad, her thick slippers so shapeless
by reason of the corns and bunions that pertained to the feet within? The "instantaneous rush
of several guardian angels" that once stood dear old Hepzibah Pynchon in good stead was wanting
here,--or perhaps they stood by all-invisible, their calm eyes softened with love deeper than
tears, at this spectacle so ludicrous to man, beholding in the grotesque dress and adornments
only the budding of life's divinest blossom, and in the strange skips and hops of her first
attempts at dancing only the buoyancy of those inner wings that goodness and generosity and
pure self-devotion were shaping for a future strong and stately flight upward. However, men,
women, and children do not see with angelic eyes, and the titterings of her fellow-pupils were
irrepressible; one bouncing girl nearly choked herself with her hand-kerchief trying not to
laugh, and two or three did not even try. Monsieur Leclerc could not blame them,--at first
he could scarce control his own facial muscles; but a sense of remorse smote him, as he saw
how unconscious and earnest the little woman was, and remembered how often those knotty hands
and knobbed feet had waited on his need or his comfort. Presently he tapped on his violin for
a few moments' respite, and approached Miss Lucinda as respectfully as if she had been a queen.

"You are ver' tired, Mees Lucinda?" said he.

"I am a little, Sir," said she, out of breath. "I am not used to dancing; it's quite an exertion."

"It is that truly. If you are too much tired, is it better to wait? I shall finish for you
the lesson till I come to-night for a French conversation?"

"I guess I will go home," said the simple little lady. "I am some afraid of getting rheumatism;
but use makes perfect, and I shall stay through next time, no doubt."

"So I believe," said Monsieur, with his best bow, as Miss Lucinda departed and went home, pondering
all the way what special delicacy she should provide for tea.

"My dear young friends," said Monsieur Leclerc, pausing with the uplifted bow in his hand,
before he recommenced his lesson, "I have observe that my new pupil does make you much to laugh.
I am not so surprise, for you do not know all, and the good God does not robe all angels in
one manner; but she have taken me to her mansion with a leg broken, and have nursed me like
a saint of the blessed, nor with any pay of silver except that I teach her the dance and the
French. They are pay for the meat and the drink, but she will have no more for her good patience
and care. I like to teach you the dance, but she could teach you the saints' ways, which are
better. I think you will no more to laugh."

"No! I guess we won't!" said the bouncing girl with great emphasis, and the color rose over
more than one young face.

After that day Miss Lucinda received many a kind smile and hearty welcome, and never did anybody
venture even a grimace at her expense. But it must be acknowledged that her dancing was at
least peculiar. With a sanitary view of the matter, she meant to make it exercise, and fearful
was the skipping that ensued. She chassed on tiptoe, and balanced with an indescribable hopping
twirl, that made one think of a chickadee pursuing its quest of food on new-ploughed ground;
and some late-awakened feminine instinct of dress, restrained, too, by due economy, indued
her with the oddest decorations that woman ever devised. The French lessons went on more smoothly.
If Monsieur Leclerc's Parisian ear was tortured by the barbarous accent of Vermont, at least
he bore it with heroism, since there was nobody else to hear; and very pleasant, both to our
little lady and her master, were these long winter evenings, when they diligently waded through
Racine, and even got as far as the golden periods of Chateaubriand. The pets fared badly for
petting in these days; they were fed and waited on, but not with the old devotion; it began
to dawn on Miss Lucinda's mind that something to talk to was preferable, as a companion, even
to Fun, and that there might be a stranger sweetness in receiving care and protection than
in giving it.

Spring came at last. Its softer skies were as blue over Dalton as in the wide fields without,
and its footsteps as bloom-bringing in Miss Lucinda's garden as in mead or forest. Now Monsieur
Leclerc came to her aid again at odd minutes, and set her flower-beds with mignonette borders,
and her vegetable-garden with salad herbs of new and flourishing kinds. Yet not even the sweet
season seemed to hurry the catastrophe that we hope, dearest reader, thy tender eyes have long
seen impending. No, for this quaint alliance a quainter Cupid waited,--the chubby little fellow
with a big head and a little arrow, who waits on youth and loveliness, was not wanted here.
Lucinda's God of Love wore a lank, hard-featured, grizzly shape, no less than that of Israel
Slater, who marched into the garden one fine June morning, earlier than usual, to find Monsieur
in his blouse, hard at work weeding the cauliflower-bed.

"Good mornin', Sir! good mornin'!" said Israel, in answer to the Frenchman's greeting. "This
is a real slick little garden-spot as ever I see, and a pootty house, and a real clever woman
too. I'll be skwitched, ef it a'n't a fust-rate consarn, the hull on't. Be you ever a-goin'
back to France, Mister?"

"No, my goot friend. I have nobody there. I stay here; I have friend here: but there,--oh,
non! je ne reviendrai pas! ah, jamais! jamais!"

"Pa's dead, eh? or shamming? Well, I don't understand your lingo; but ef you're a-goin' to
stay here, I don't see why you don't hitch hosses with Miss Lucindy."

Monsieur Leclerc looked up astonished.

"Horses, my friend? I have no horse!"

"Thunder 'n' dry trees! I didn't say you hed, did I? But that comes o' usin' what Parson Hyde
calls figgurs, I s'pose. I wish't he'd use one kind o' figgurin' a leetle more; he'd pay me
for that wood-sawin'. I didn't mean nothin' about hosses. I sot out fur to say, Why don't ye
marry Miss Lucindy?"

"I?" gasped Monsieur,--"I, the foreign, the poor? I could not to presume so!"

"Well, I don't see 's it's sech drefful presumption. Ef you're poor, she's a woman, and real
lonesome too; she ha'n't got nuther chick nor child belongin' to her, and you're the only man
she ever took any kind of a notion to. I guess 't would be jest as much for her good as yourn."

"Hush, good Is-ray-el! it is good to stop there. She would not to marry after such years of
goodness: she is a saint of the blessed."

"Well, I guess saints sometimes fellerships with sinners; I've heerd tell they did; and ef
I was you, I'd make trial for 't. Nothin' ventur', nothin' have."

Whereupon Israel walked off, whistling.

Monsieur Leclerc's soul was perturbed within him by these suggestions; he pulled up two young
cauliflowers and reset their places with pigweeds; he hoed the nicely sloped border of the
bed flat to the path, and then flung the hoe across the walk, and went off to his daily occupation
with a new idea in his head. Nor was it an unpleasant one. The idea of a transition from his
squalid and pinching boarding-house to the delicate comfort of Miss Lucinda's ménage, the prospect
of so kind and good a wife to care for his hitherto dreaded future,--all this was pleasant.
I cannot honestly say he was in love with our friend; I must even confess that whatever element
of that nature existed between the two was now all on Miss Lucinda's side, little as she knew
it. Certain it is, that, when she appeared that day at the dancing-class in a new green calico
flowered with purple, and bows on her slippers big enough for a bonnet, it occurred to Monsieur
Leclerc, that, if they were married, she would take no more lessons! However, let us not blame
him; he was a man, and a poor one; one must not expect too much from men, or from poverty;
if they are tolerably good, let us canonize them even, it is so hard for the poor creatures!
And to do Monsieur Leclerc justice, he had a very thorough respect and admiration for Miss
Lucinda. Years ago, in his stormy youth-time, there had been a pair of soft-fringed eyes that
looked into his as none would ever look again,--and they murdered her, those mad wild beasts
of Paris, in the chapel where she knelt at her pure prayers,--murdered her because she knelt
beside an aristocrat, her best friend, the Duchess of Montmorenci, who had taken the pretty
peasant from her own estate to bring her up for her maid. Jean Leclerc had lifted that pale
shape from the pavement and buried it himself; what else he buried with it was invisible; but
now he recalled the hour with a long, shuddering sigh, and, hiding his face in his hands, said
softly, "The violet is dead,--there is no spring for her. I will have now an amaranth,--it
is good for the tomb."

Whether Miss Lucinda's winter dress suggested this floral metaphor let us not inquire. Sacred
be sentiment,--when there is even a shadow of reality about it!--when it becomes a profession,
and confounds itself with millinery and shades of mourning, it is--"bosh," as the Turkeys say.

So that very evening Monsieur Leclerc arrayed himself in his best, to give another lesson to
Miss Lucinda. But, somehow or other, the lesson was long in beginning; the little parlor looked
so home-like and so pleasant, with its bright lamp and gay bunch of roses on the table, that
it was irresistible temptation to lounge and linger. Miss Lucinda had the volume of Florian
in her hands, and was wondering why he did not begin, when the book was drawn away, and a hand
laid on both of hers.

"Lucinda!" he began, "I give you no lesson to-night. I have to ask. Dear Mees, will you to
marry your poor slave?"

"Oh, dear!" said Miss Lucinda.

Don't laugh at her, Miss Tender-eyes! You will feel just so yourself some day, when Alexander
Augustus says, "Will you be mine, loveliest of jour sex?" only you won't feel it half so strongly,
for you are young, and love is Nature to youth, but it is a heavenly surprise to age.

Monsieur Leclerc said nothing. He had a heart after all, and it was touched now by the deep
emotion that flushed Miss Lucinda's face, and made her tremble so violently,--but presently
he spoke.

"Do not!" said he. "I am wrong. I presume. Forgive the stranger!"

"Oh, dear!" said poor Lucinda again,--"oh, you know it isn't that! but how can you like me?"

There, Mademoiselle! there's humility for you! you will never say that to Alexander Augustus!

Monsieur Leclerc soothed this frightened, happy, incredulous little woman into quiet before
very long; and if he really began to feel a true affection for her from the moment he perceived
her humble and entire devotion to him, who shall blame him? Not I. If we were all heroes, who
would be valet-de-chambre? if we were all women, who would be men? He was very good as far
as he went; and if you expect the chivalries of grace out of Nature, you "may expect," as old
Fuller saith. So it was peacefully settled that they should be married, with a due amount of
tears and smiles on Lucinda's part, and a great deal of tender sincerity on Monsieur's. She
missed her dancing-lesson next day, and when Monsieur Leclerc came in the evening he found
a shade on her happy face.

"Oh, dear!" said she, as he entered.

"Oh, dear!" was Lucinda's favorite aspiration. Had she thought of it as an Anglicizing of "O
Dieu!" perhaps she would have dropped it; but this time she went on headlong, with a valorous
despair,--

"I have thought of something! I'm afraid I can't! Monsieur, aren't you a Romanist?"

"What is that?" said he, surprised.

"A Papist,--a Catholic!"

"Ah!" he returned, sighing, "once I was bon Catholique,--once in my gone youth; after then
I was nothing but the poor man who bats for his life; now I am of the religion that shelters
the stranger and binds up the broken poor."

Monsieur was a diplomatist. This melted Miss Lucinda's orthodoxy right down; she only said,--

"Then you will go to church with me?"

"And to the skies above, I pray," said Monsieur, kissing her knotty hand like a lover.

So in the earliest autumn they were married, Monsieur having previously presented Miss Lucinda
with a delicate plaided gray silk for her wedding attire, in which she looked almost young;
and old Israel was present at the ceremony, which was briefly performed by Parson Hyde in Miss
Manners's parlor. They did not go to Niagara, nor to Newport; but that afternoon Monsieur Leclerc
brought a hired rockaway to the door, and took his bride a drive into the country. They stopped
beside a pair of bars, where Monsieur hitched his horse, and, taking Lucinda by the hand, led
her into Farmer Steele's orchard, to the foot of his biggest apple-tree. There she beheld a
little mound, at the head and foot of which stood a daily rose-bush shedding its latest wreaths
of bloom, and upon the mound itself was laid a board on which she read,

"Here lie the bones of poor Piggy."

Mrs. Lucinda burst into tears, and Monsieur, picking a bud from the bush, placed it in her
hand, and led her tenderly back to the rockaway.

That evening Mrs. Lucinda was telling the affair to old Israel with so much feeling that she
did not perceive at all the odd commotion in his face, till, as she repeated the epitaph to
him, he burst out with,--"He didn't say what become o' the flesh, did he?"--and therewith fled
through the kitchen-door. For years afterward Israel would entertain a few favored auditors
with his opinion of the matter, screaming till the tears rolled down his cheeks,--

"That was the beateree of all the weddin'-towers I ever heerd tell on. Goodness! it's enough
to make the Wanderin' Jew die o' larfin'!"

A SOLDIER'S ANCESTRY.

  When Nadir asked a princess for his son,
    And Delhi's throne required his pedigree,
  He stared upon the messenger as one
    Who should have known his birth of bravery.

  "Go back," he cried, in undissembled scorn,
    "And bear this answer to your waiting lord:--
  'My child is noble! for, though lowly born,
    He is the son and grandson of the Sword!'"

FIBRILIA.

There are not a few timid souls who imagine that England is falling into decay. Our Cousin
John is apt to complain. He has been accustomed to enlarge upon his debts, his church-rates
and poor-rates, his taxes on air, light, motion, "everything, from the ribbons of the bride
to the brass nails of the coffin," upon the wages of his servants both on the land and the
water, upon his Irish famine and exodus, and his vast expenses at home and abroad. And when
we consider how small is his homestead, a few islands in a high latitude inferior to those
of Japan in size and climate, and how many of his family have left him to better their condition,
one might easily conclude that he had passed his meridian, and that his prospects were as cloudy
as his atmosphere.

But our Cousin John, with a strong constitution, is in a green old age, and still knows how
to manage his property.

Within the last two years he has quietly extinguished sixty millions of his debts in terminable
annuities. He has improved his outlying lands of Scotland and Ireland, ransacked the battle-fields
of Europe for bone-dust and the isles of the Pacific for guano, and imported enough to fertilize
four millions of acres, and, not content with the produce of his home-farm, imports the present
year more than four millions of tons of grain and corn to feed nineteen millions of his people.

He has carried his annual exports up to six hundred and thirty millions of dollars, and importing
more than he exports still leaves the world his debtor. He has a strong fancy for new possessions,
and selects the most productive spots for his plantations. When he desired muslin, calico,
and camel's-hair shawls for his family, he put his finger on India; and when he called for
those great staples of commerce, indigo, saltpetre, jute, flax, and linseed, India sent them
at his bidding. When he required coffee, he found Ceylon a Spice Island, and at his demand
it furnished him with an annual supply of sixty millions of pounds. He required more sugar
for his coffee, and by shipping a few coolies from Calcutta and Bombay to the Mauritius, once
the Isle of France, it yields him annually two hundred and forty million pounds of sugar, more
than St. Domingo ever yielded in the palmy days of slavery. He wanted wool, and his flocks
soon overspread the plains of Australia, tendering him the finest fleeces, and his shepherds
improved their leisure not in playing like Tityrus on the reed, but in opening for him mines
of copper and gold. He had his eye on California, but Fremont was too quick for him, and he
now contents himself with pocketing a large proportion of her gold, to say nothing of the silver
of Mexico and Peru.

Wherever there is a canal to be excavated, a railway to be built, or a line of steamers to
be established, our Cousin John is ready with a full purse to favor the enterprise. He turns
even his sailors and soldiers to good account: the other day he subdued one hundred and fifty
millions of rebels in the Indies, and then we find him dictating a treaty of peace and a tribute
to the Emperor of China from the ruins of his summer-palace and the walls of Pekin. Although
generally well disposed, especially towards his kith and kin this side the water, he is choleric,
and if his best customers treat him ill, he does not hesitate to knock them down. Although
dependent on Russia for his hemp and naval stores, and on China for his raw silk and teas,
he suffers no such considerations to deter him from fighting, and usually gets some advantage
when he comes to terms. He is belting the world with colonies, and forming agencies for his
children wherever he can send the messengers of his commerce. At this very moment he is considering
whether he shall transport coolies from China to Australia, Natal, or the Feegee Islands, to
raise his cotton and help put down Secession and export-duties, or whether he shall give a
new stimulus to India cotton by railways and irrigation. He seems to prosper in all his business;
for the "Edinburgh Review" reports him worth six thousand millions of pounds, at least,--a
very comfortable provision for his family.

The wealth and power of Great Britain are supposed to rest upon her mines of iron and coal.
These undoubtedly help to sustain the fabric. With her iron and coal, she fashions and propels
the winged Mercuries of her commerce; with these and the clay that underlies her soil, she
erects her factories and workshops; these form the Briarean arms by which she fabricates her
tissues. But it is by more minute columns than these, it is by the hollow tubes revealed by
the microscope, the fibres of silk, wool, and flax, hemp, jute, and cotton, that she sustains
the great structure of her wealth. These she spins, weaves, and prints into draperies which
exact a tribute from the world. During the year 1860 Great Britain imported or produced a million
tons of such fibres, an amount equal to five million bales of cotton, more than one-half of
which were in cotton alone. These fibres it is our purpose to examine.

The thread of the silk-worm came early into use. The Chinese ascribe its introduction to the
wife of one of their emperors, to whom divine honors were subsequently paid. Until the Christian
era silk was little known in Europe or Western Asia. It is mentioned but three times in the
common version of the Old Testament, and in each case the accuracy of the translation is questioned
by German critics. It is, however, distinctly alluded to by St. John, by Aristotle, and by
the poets who flourished at the court of Augustus, Virgil, Horace, and Tibullus, and is referred
to by the writers of the first four centuries. Tertullian, in his homily on Female Attire,
tells the ladies,--"Clothe yourselves with the silk of truth, with the fine linen of sanctity,
and the purple of modesty." The golden-mouthed St. Chrisostom writes in his Homilies,--"Does
the rich man wear silken shawls? His soul is in tatters." "Silken shawls are beautiful, but
they are the production of worms."

The silken thread was early introduced. Galen recommends it for tying blood-vessels in surgical
operations, and remarks that the rich ladies in the cities of the Roman Empire generally possessed
such thread; he alludes also to shawls interwoven with gold, the material of which is brought
from a distance, and is called Sericum, or silk. Down to the time of the Emperor Aurelian silk
was of great value, and used only by the rich. His biographer informs us that Aurelian neither
had himself in his wardrobe a garment composed wholly of silk, nor presented any to others,
and when his own wife begged him to allow her a single shawl of purple silk, he replied,--"Far
be it from me to permit thread to be balanced with its weight in gold!"--for a pound of gold
was then the price of a pound of silk.

Silk is mentioned in some very ancient Arabic inscriptions; but down to the reign of the Emperor
Justinian was imported into Europe from the country of the Seres, a people of Eastern Asia,
supposed to be the Chinese, from, whom it derived its name. During the reign of Justinian two
monks brought the eggs of the silkworm to Byzantium from Serinda in India, and the manufacture
of silk became a royal monopoly of the Roman Empire.

From Greece the culture of silk was gradually carried into Italy and Spain, and English abbots
and bishops often returned from Rome with vestments of silk and gold. Silken threads are attached
to the covers of ancient English manuscripts. Silk in the form of velvet may be seen on some
of the ancient armor in the Tower of London; and portions of silk garments were found in 1827
in the Cathedral of Durham, on opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert. The use of silk, however,
was so rare in England down to the time of the Tudors, that a pair of silk hose formed an acceptable
present to Queen Elizabeth.

The principal supply of raw silk is now derived from China, where silks are much worn, and
there Marco Polo several centuries since found silk robes in very general use. Japan also abounds
in silk, and the late Japanese embassy and suite were arrayed in garments of that material.

The annual consumption of raw silk in Great Britain now averages seven millions of pounds,
and the value of the annual export of silk fabrics is not far from ten millions of dollars.

The manufacture of silk was introduced into England by the French Protestants who were driven
into exile on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Their descendants are still found in London
and Coventry, where the silk-trade has been long established, and is now going through the
ordeal to which it has been exposed by the new treaty with France.

The French undoubtedly take the lead in silk fabrics, for which they are admirably qualified
by exquisite taste and great artistic skill; but the silk manufacture in England is now so
interwoven, in many of its branches, with the manufacture of wool and cotton, and aided by
improved machinery, that it may be considered as firmly established.

Our own climate is well adapted to the silk-worm, and we have had our Morus-multicaulis fever;
but so light is the freight on silk compared with its value, that we must defer our hope of
any extended growth until the price of labor in Europe approaches nearer to our own, or until
the excess of production in other branches shall divert genius into this channel, in which
it will eventually cheapen production by machinery as it has done in other enterprises.

       *       *       *       *       *

We read in the classics of the Colchian and Milesian fleeces, of the soft wools of Italy, and
of the transfer of sheep from Italy to Bastica, in Spain. Italy and Spain were both adapted
to sheep husbandry. Virgil writes,--

  "Hic gelidi fontes, hie mollia prata, Lycori";

while Spain, with her alternations of hill and dale and her varying climate, was eminently
fitted for the pasturage of sheep. Even in ancient times Spain furnished wool of great fineness
and of various colors, and cloths like the modern plaids were woven there from wool of different
shades. Sometimes the Spanish sheep was immersed alive in the Tyrian purple.

In modern times, the sheep of Spain have been introduced into France and Germany, and from
them have sprung the French merino and Saxony varieties. These again have been exported to
Natal and Australia.

Before the American Revolution, the sheep of this country furnished a wool so coarse that English
travellers reported that America could never compete with England in broadcloth. But when the
French armies overran Spain, the vast flocks of merinos which annually traversed the country
in search of fresh pasturage were driven into Portugal, and by the enterprise of Messrs. Jarvis,
Derby, and Humphrey, large numbers of them were imported into our Northern States. These have
improved our wool, until now it surpasses the English in fineness.

The fine-wool sheep thrive most in a dry climate and elevated country. We learn from Strabo,
Columella, and Martial, that the fine wool of Italy was raised principally among the Apennines;
and in Spain, Estremadura, a part of the ancient Baetica, is still famous for its wool. There
the Spanish flocks winter, and thence in spring are sent to pasture in the mountains of Leon
and Asturias. Other flocks are led in the same season from great distances to the heights of
the Sierra Morena, where the vegetation is remarkably favorable to improvement of the wool.

In this country, the elevated lands of Texas and New Mexico are admirably adapted to the fine-wool
sheep; and upon the head-waters of the Missouri and the Yellowstone is another district much
resembling the Spanish sheep-walks, where the mountain-sheep and the antelope still predominate.

When Caesar invaded England he found there great numbers of flocks, and for many centuries
wool was the great staple of English exports; but during the reign of Queen Elizabeth numerous
artisans were driven from Brabant and Flanders by the Duke of Alva, and the manufacture of
wool, which had enriched the Low Countries, was permanently established in England.

With the progress of agriculture, the turnip-culture enabled Great Britain to increase the
number of her sheep; but they were raised more for the market than for their fleeces, which
were rarely fine, and the demand for wool soon exceeded the supply. England then opened her
ports to the free importation of wool from every region, and now annually manufactures two
hundred millions of pounds, twice the amount manufactured in this country, of which two-thirds
are drawn from distant lands, and her export of woollens for 1860 exceeded one hundred millions
of dollars.

The same policy which has built up this vast manufacture, namely, the free importation of the
raw material and of every article used in its manufacture, with a moderate duty on foreign
cloths, will enable us to compete with England. Our farmers' wives prefer the sheep-husbandry
to the care of the dairy; much of our land furnishes cheap pasturage, and the prices of mutton
are remunerative; but many of the low grades of wool come from abroad, and the mill-owner will
not embark largely in the manufacture, unless he can purchase his materials as cheaply as his
foreign competitor.

       *       *       *       *       *

Cotton is mentioned by Herodotus five centuries before the Christian era. He alludes to the
cotton-trees of India, and describes a cuirass sent from Egypt to the King of Sparta embellished
with gold and with fleeces from trees. Theophrastus, the disciple of Aristotle, notices the
growth of cotton both in India and Arabia, and observes that the cotton-plants of India have
a leaf like the black mulberry, and are set on the plains in rows, resembling vines in the
distance. On the Persian Gulf he noticed that they bore no fruit, but a capsule about the size
of a quince, which, when ripe, expanded so as to set free the wool, which was woven into cloth
of various kinds, both very cheap and of great value.

The cotton-plant was observed by the Greeks who accompanied Alexander in his march to India:
and his officers have left a description of the cotton dress and turban which formed the costume
of the natives at that remote period.

Cotton early found its way into Egypt, then the seat of arts and of commerce; for Pliny in
his "Natural History" informs us that "in Upper Egypt, towards Arabia, there grows a shrub
which some call Gossypion and others Xylon. It is small, and bears a fruit resembling the filbert,
within which is a downy wool that is spun into thread. There is nothing to be preferred to
these stuffs for whiteness or softness. Beautiful garments are made from them for the priests
of Egypt."

The troops of Anthony wore cotton when he visited Cleopatra, and she was arrayed in vestments
of fine muslin. It was soon after used for the sails of vessels, and the Romans employed it
for awnings in the Forum and the Amphitheatres.

It was cultivated at an early period in the Levant, whence it was gradually introduced into
Sicily, France, and England.

Arabian travellers who reached China in the ninth century did not observe the cotton-plant
in that country, but found the natives clad in silk.

The cotton-plant, although indigenous in India, has also been found growing spontaneously in
many parts of Africa. It was discovered by Columbus in Hispaniola, and among the presents sent
by Cortés to Charles V. were cotton mantles, vests, and carpets of various figures, and in
the conquest of Mexico the Indian allies wore armor of quilted cotton, impervious to arrows.

The plant of India resembles that of America in most particulars. It is there often placed
in alternate rows with rice, and after the rice-harvest is over puts forth a beautiful yellow
flower with a crimson eye in each petal; this is succeeded by a green pod filled with a white
pulp, which as it ripens turns brown, and then separates into several divisions containing
the cotton. A luxuriant field, says Forbes in his "Oriental Memoirs," "exhibits at the same
time the expanding blossom, the bursting capsule, and the snowy fleeces of pure cotton, and
is one of the most beautiful objects in the agriculture of Hindostan."

The manufacture of cotton in India, with very simple machinery, was early brought to high perfection.
Travellers in the ninth century describe muslins in India which were of such fineness that
they might be drawn through a ring of moderate size; and Tavernier speaks of turbans, composed
of thirty-five ells of the cloth, which would weigh but four ounces. Muslin has been sold in
India for five hundred rupees the piece, so fine, that, when laid upon the grass after the
dew had fallen, it was no longer visible. The patience, the nice sense of touch, and the flexible
fingers of the Hindoos have with the simplest means achieved results in this branch of manufacture
which have not been surpassed by any people.

But this manufacture is now breathing its last; the cotton-gin, the spinning-frame, the mule
with its countless spindles, and the power-loom are fearful competitors; and although British
India still produces quite as much cotton as our Southern States, and while she exports at
least eight hundred thousand bales annually to England and China, continues at the same time
to make the larger part of her own clothing, flourishing cities, like Dacca and Delhi, once
the seat of manufactures, are going to decay, and a large proportion of her people, willing
to toil at six cents per day in occupations that have been transmitted for centuries in the
same families, are either driven to the culture of the fields or compelled to spin and weave
for a pittance the jute which is converted into gunny-cloth.

When India muslins and calicoes were first imported into England, they met with a formidable
opposition. They had suddenly become fashionable, and threatened to supersede the long-established
woollens; and the nation, in its wisdom, first prohibited the importation of these fabrics,
and then subjected them to a duty of sixpence per yard. In France, Amiens, Rouen, and Paris
protested against cotton as ruinous to the country. But it has surmounted all these obstacles,
is firmly established in both nations, and now its manufacture gives support to one-seventh
part of the population of Great Britain, employs there thirty-four millions of spindles, consumes
annually two and a half million bales of the raw material, and sends abroad, in addition to
thread and yarn, twenty-eight hundred million yards of fabrics, of the aggregate value of two
hundred and thirty millions of dollars.

In 1856, Great Britain derived her supply of cotton from the following countries, namely:--

  From the United States          71     per cent.
  "   the East Indies             19      "    "
  "   Brazil                       5      "    "
  "   Egypt                        4-1/2  "    "
  "   the West Indies                1/2  "    "

But while her supply from India in the twelve years from 1845 to 1857 increased nearly two
hundred per cent, namely, from two hundred thousand to six hundred thousand bales, she has
increased her exports of cotton fabrics to that country to such an extent, that, for every
pound she imports, she returns a pound of thread and cloth enhanced at least fourfold in value,
while she returns to the United States in cotton fabrics less than three per cent, of the cotton
she receives from them. And since 1857 such improvements have been made in the cotton-mills
of New England, that we now consume more than a million of bales annually, and our production
and export are rapidly increasing.

Some curious alternations have attended the growth and manufacture of cotton. As machinery
has improved and the cost of goods diminished, the price of cotton has advanced and a strong
stimulus been given to its production.

New States have consequently been opened to its culture, and the alluvial lands of Alabama,
Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas have been devoted to the plant. Slaves have thus
been attracted from the Middle States and diverted from the less profitable culture of wheat
and tobacco to the cotton-fields. Half a century since, the Middle States contained two-thirds
of the negroes of the Union; but under the census of 1860 two millions and a half of slaves
are now found south of North Carolina, and but a million and a half north of the Cotton States.
In the Cotton States the negroes nearly equal the white population; in the Border States the
whites are at least four to one. In the Cotton States the slaves and the culture of cotton
are increasing at the rate of at least five per cent.; in the Border States the slave population
is either stationary or retrograde, and the future of those States is clearly indicated. Down
to a recent period the march of the planter and his forces across the Cotton States has been
like that of an invading army. Vast forests of heavy timber have been felled, land rapidly
exhausted and abandoned, and new fields opened and soon deserted for a virgin soil.

But with the increased demand of the last seven years for cotton, and with the enhanced price
of the slave, which rises at least one hundred dollars with each advance of a cent per pound
on cotton, more permanent improvements have been made, railways have been opened, and at least
fifty thousand tons of guano and cotton-seed have been annually applied to the exhausted cotton-fields
of the Carolinas and Georgia. Under these appliances the crops of the United States have kept
pace with the manufacture, and in 1859 rose to the amount of twenty-one hundred millions of
pounds, thus replenishing the markets that had been recently exhausted, and actually exceeding
the entire consumption for the same year of both Europe and America.

But the crops fluctuate from year to year, and a less favorable season for 1860, accompanied
by an increase of at least ten per cent. in spindles, leaves the supply barely equal to the
demand, while the diminished crop, and the cry of Secession at the South, with the introduction
of an export-duty, have alarmed the spinners of England and led them to consider the effects
of a deficiency and to seek new sources of supply.

With the progress of trade the price of the middling cotton of America for the last fifteen
years has varied at Liverpool from fourpence to ninepence per pound, and now stands at seven
and a halfpence by the last quotations. As the stock accumulates or the sale of goods is checked,
the price naturally declines, and a check is given to production. As the stock declines or
goods advance, an impetus is given to prices, the culture is extended, and cotton flows in
from Egypt and India. When the cotton of Bombay commands more than fivepence per pound at Liverpool,
it flows in a strong current from India to Manchester. Should the export-duty be levied in
the Cotton States, it may well be presumed that the burden will fall principally upon the planter,
and give an additional stimulus to the growth of India, and a new incentive to the British
Government to start the culture in other colonies.

The gentlemen of the South sometimes imagine that Old England, as well as New England, is entirely
dependent upon cotton, and that society there would be disintegrated, if the crop in the Cotton
States should be withheld for a single year. But the Northern mills have usually six months'
supply; and Great Britain holds upon an average enough for three months in her ports, for two
months at her mills, and as much more upon the ocean. The English spinner, too, can not only
reduce his time one-fourth without stopping, but can reduce his consumption another fourth
by raising his numbers and increasing the fineness of his cloth; and as he draws one-fourth
of his supply from other countries, it is obvious that he might hold out for nearly two years
without a bale from America.

Could the cotton-planter hold out any longer? Let it not be forgotten that the Embargo was
voted to bring England to terms by withholding rice, cotton, wheat, and naval stores, but proved
a signal failure. We reaped from it no harvests, and were put back by it at least six years
in our national progress; while England enjoyed the carrying-trade of the world, which we had
abandoned, and drew her supplies from Russia and India while our crops perished in our own
warehouses.

The vast export of cotton goods from Great Britain to India has now liberated at least half
a million bales of cotton for the supply of England in addition to what India previously furnished;
and as the export of goods to India and China continues to increase, the surplus of cotton
must rise with it. But India is able to treble her production. It is true that the staple of
her cotton suffers from the dry summers, that her land is but half tilled by ploughs consisting
of a simple beam of wood with two prongs and a single handle, that she has been destitute of
roads and facilities for transportation, that her lands are held at oppressive rents, that
American planters there have failed to make good cotton, and that the annual yield of her soil
is as small as that of the exhausted fields of South Carolina. But still she produces at least
four million bales of cotton, and great changes are now in progress: railways are pervading
the country; canals are being dug for irrigating, and irrigation quadruples the crop, while
it improves the staple; and the diversion of a few districts from the ordinary crops, with
improved tillage, will increase the production to an indefinite extent.

The latest intelligence from India apprises us that in one large cotton district the American
planters have at length succeeded, and American cotton is now growing there on one hundred
and forty-six thousand acres.

IN DARWAR.

  In American Cotton.  In Native Kupas.   Total.
  1851   31,688 acres      223,314 acres      255,002
  1860  146,320  "         230,677  "         377,003

In Africa, also, the export of cotton is on the increase; and Egypt is erecting new works to
retain and direct the overflow of the Nile, which will augment her exports.

There is a belt around the earth's surface of at least sixty degrees in width, adapted in great
part to the culture of cotton. Great Britain now commands capital, while China and India overflow
with labor. Let Great Britain divert a few millions of this capital and but half a million
of coolies to any fertile area of five thousand square miles within this belt, and she can
in a few years double her supply of cotton, and command the residue of her importation at reasonable
prices.

Among these spots none is more promising than Central America, where the cotton-plant is perennial,
and a single acre, as we are assured by Mr. Squier, yields semiannually a bale of superior
cotton. But let us hope that the South may abandon her dream of a Southern Empire, and the
chimera which now haunts her, that the Northerner is hostile to the Southerner, when in reality
he has no such feeling, but merely recoils from institutions which he believes to be at variance
with moral and material progress.

Hemp, or Cannabis sativa, from which we possibly derive the modern term canvas, was known to
the ancients and used by them for rope and cordage and occasionally for cloth. It was found
early in Thrace, in Caria, and upon the Rhone. Herodotus says that garments were made of it
by the Thracians "so much like linen that none but an experienced person could tell whether
they were made of hemp or of flax."

Moschion, who flourished two centuries before the Christian era, states that the celebrated
ship Syracusia built by Hiero II. was provided with rope made from the hemp of the Rhone. Although
the plant is indigenous in Northern India, where it is cultivated for its narcotic qualities,
it is adapted to a southern climate; and we may safely infer that it was not a native of either
Italy, Greece, or Asia Minor, but was doubtless introduced into Caria by the active trade between
the Euxine and Miletus. Cloth of hemp is still worn by boatmen upon the Danube; but although
its fibre is nearly as delicate as that of flax and cotton, it is used principally for cordage,
for which purpose it is imported from the interior of Russia into England and the United States.
In 1858 the entire importation into Great Britain was forty-four thousand tons. A large amount
is now raised in Missouri and Kentucky, whose soil is admirably adapted to the hemp-plant.
Hemp grows freely in Bologna, Romagna, and Naples, and the Italians have a saying, that "it
may be grown everywhere, but cannot be produced fit for use in heaven or on earth without manure."
The Italian hemp is aided by irrigation.

The plant is annual, and attains a height of three to ten feet, according to the soil and climate.
Its stalk is hollow, filled with a soft pith, and surrounded by a cellular texture coated with
a delicate membrane which runs parallel to the stalk and is covered by a thin cuticle. In Russia
the seed is sown in June and gathered in September.

The Manila hemp (Musa textilis) does not appear to have been known to the ancients, and is
now found in the Philippine Islands, the Indian Archipelago, and Japan, regions unexplored
by the ancients. It is also found at the base of the Himalaya Mountains. It is a large herbaceous
plant, which requires a warm climate, and is cut after a growth of eighteen months. The outer
layers or fibres of the plant are called the bandola, which is used in the fabrication of cordage;
the inner layers have a more delicate fibre called the lupis, which is woven into fine fabrics;
while the intermediate layers, termed tupoz, are made into cloth of different degrees of fineness.

The filaments, after they are gathered, are separated by a knife, and rendered soft and pliable
by beating them with a mallet; their ends are then gummed together, after which they are wound
into balls, and the finer qualities are woven without going through the process of spinning.
With the produce of this plant the natives pay their tribute, purchase the necessaries of life,
and provide themselves with clothing.

The imports of this article into Great Britain in 1859 were very considerable, while the United
States also imported a very large amount. It is used for cordage by the ships of both countries.
In one respect it differs from wool, cotton, and hemp, the fibres of all of which are found
by the microscope to consist of tubes, while the filaments of the Musa textilis, although often
fine, are in no case hollow, and consequently are less flexible and divisible than other fibres.

Within the last twenty years, a new export from India, in the shape of Jute and its fabrics,
has grown up from insignificance into commercial importance, and is now among the chief exports
of the country. This article demands our particular attention, as it requires but four months
for its production, furnishes a very large supply of textile material, is raised at one-fifth
the expense of cotton, and has been sold in India as low as one cent per pound.

Jute is generally grown as an after-crop in India upon high ground, and flourishes best in
a hot and rainy season. The seed is sown broadcast in April or May, when there is sufficient
rain to moisten the ground. When the plant is a foot and a half high it is weeded. It rises
on good soil to the height of twelve feet, and flowers between August and September. The stems
are usually three-fourths of an inch in diameter. The leaves have long foot-stalks, the flowers
are small and yellow, and the capsules short and globose, containing five cells for the seed.
The fruit ripens in September and October. The average yield in fibre to the acre is from four
hundred to seven hundred pounds. When the crop is ripe, the stems are cut close to the root,
made up into bundles, and deposited for a week in some neighboring pond or stream.

The process of separating the fibre from the stem is thus described by Mr. Healy in the "Journal
of Agriculture for India";--

"The native operator, standing up to his middle in water, takes as many of the sticks in his
hands as he can grasp, and removing a small portion of the bark from the end next the roots,
and grasping them together, he with a little management strips off the whole from end to end,
without breaking either stem or fibre. He then, swinging the bark around his head, dashes it
repeatedly against the surface of the water, drawing it towards him to wash off the impurities."

The filaments are then hung up to dry in the sun, often in lengths of twelve feet, and when
dried the jute is ready for the market.

The color at first is a pure white, but gradually changes to yellow. The fibre, which is fine
and delicate, is tubular, like that of flax and cotton, and is easily wrought; but its tenacity
is not equal to that of other textile materials, although it is substituted in many fabrics
for wool, flax, and cotton. A large portion of the crop, which already exceeds two hundred
thousand tons, is exported to England as it comes from the field, and is there used in the
manufacture both of wool and cotton to cheapen the fabric. The vigilant eye will often detect
it in woollen manufactures, in shawls, and even in sail-cloths; but when spun with cotton or
wool, it is very difficult to discover its presence.

A few years since, there was a great reduction in the price of plaid shawls from England, which
took the dealers by surprise, as the cost was previously supposed to have reached the lowest
point; but a close examination of the threads elicited the fact that the manufacturer had adroitly
twisted in with his wool a liberal allowance of jute, costing but two or three cents a pound
when wool cost thirty, and thus reduced the price of the fabric.

By the use of shoddy in the manufacture of woollens, and of jute in both cotton and woollen
fabrics, the English artisan saves many millions of pounds both of wool and cotton. In those
districts of India where British skill and commercial enterprise have checked the manufacture
of muslin and calicoes, the Hindoos of all classes find in the culture and manufacture of jute
employment for all, "from the palanquin-bearer and husbandman down to the Hindoo widow, saved
by the interposition of England from the funeral pile, but condemned by custom for the residue
of her days literally to sackcloth and ashes." The fine and long-stapled jute is reserved for
the export trade, for which it bears a comparatively high price; the residue is spun and woven
by these classes as a domestic manufacture; it is made into gunny-cloth, which is circulated
through the globe, forms the bagging for our corn, wheat, and cotton on their voyage to distant
ports, and finally makes its last appearance as paper.

The long stems of the jute are highly esteemed in India; they resemble willow wands, are useful
for basket-work and fencing, for trellis-work and the support of vines, and to make a charcoal
which is valued for the manufacture of gunpowder.

The export of jute from India to England for 1859 was sixty thousand tons. The export of gunny-cloth
from India to the United States in the same year amounted to several millions of pieces.

Why should not this valuable plant be introduced into America? It requires the same season
and soil as our Indian corn, and would doubtless flourish in the rich alluvial lands of the
West, and furnish a very cheap and useful domestic manufacture for our Western farmers.

The term Linen is doubtless derived from Linum, the classic and botanic name of flax. In Holy
Writ, Moses called down the hail upon the growing flax of Lower Egypt, and Isaiah speaks of
those "that work in fine flax." According to Herodotus, the ancient Egyptians wore linen. Plutarch
informs us that the priests of Isis wore linen on account of its purity, and mentions a tradition
that flax was used for clothing "because the color of its blossom resembles the ethereal blue
which surrounds the world"; and he adds, that the priests of Isis were buried in their sacred
vestments. An eminent cotton-spinner, who subjected four hundred specimens of mummy-cloth to
the microscope, has ascertained that they were all linen; and even now, when aspiring cotton
has contested its superiority, and claimed to be more healthful and more beneficial to the
human frame, the choicest drapery of our tables and couches, and many of our most costly and
elegant articles of dress, are fabricated from flax.

Flax is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer, and requires but three months for its
growth. While cotton grows in hot climates only, flax grows both under the tropics and in temperate
climates, and as far north as Russia, Ireland, and Canada; and while at the South it runs mostly
to seed, the best varieties are produced in Normandy, Belgium, and Poland.

In another particular flax has the advantage over cotton. While the latter, under the ordinary
course of cultivation in South Carolina, yields but one bale to four acres, and in virgin soil
rarely more than one bale to two acres, flax yields in good soil from five to eight hundred
pounds of fibre to the acre, which may be converted into flax-cotton by modern machinery; and
as the product has but three per cent. waste, while cotton loses eleven per cent. in its manufacture,
the flax-cotton which is produced from a single acre is the equivalent of one to two bales
of cotton.

With these important advantages, namely, its adaptation to a northern climate where the white
man can labor, and a capacity for yielding so large an amount of fibre, flax holds a high place
in the list of textile materials.

Flax can be raised with very moderate expense up to the time of harvest. If the soil is free
from weeds, it requires little more preparation, care, or expense for its culture than wheat
or barley. But from this point onward a large expenditure of labor is requisite, which greatly
enhances the cost, carrying it up as high as ten to twenty cents per pound, according to the
degree of fineness; for the filaments must be separated from the stem by immersion in water,
must be kept in parallel lines, and prepared for the spindle by skilful and long-continued labor.

To insure the best quality, it must be pulled and bound in bundles before it is entirely ripe,
thus impairing the value of the seed, while the edible and nutritious portion of the stalk
is lost or injured in the water.

For many years it was spun on the little wheel, but of late years improved machinery has been
applied at Belfast, Leeds, Dundee, and other cities of Great Britain; yet nearly a third of
the value is lost in the broken filaments, which are reduced to tow in its preparation for
the spindle. With a fibre at least as fine and delicate as that of cotton, its full value to
the world will not be demonstrated until it is effectually cottonized.

In its present state, however, it has come into very extensive use. More than eighty thousand
tons were, in 1859, imported into Great Britain, and many acres are there devoted to its culture.
The consumption in that country is estimated to exceed one hundred and sixty thousand tons,
a quantity equivalent to eight hundred thousand bales of cotton. In addition to this, ten millions
of bushels of flax-seed are annually crushed in Great Britain, a large portion of which is
drawn from India.

The culture of flax was introduced into this country early in the last century by the Scotch,
who crossed over to Ireland under Elizabeth and Cromwell, and soon after the siege of Derry
transferred their arts and their industry to this country. Several colonies of these were planted
in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and a large colony was established at Natfield, New Hampshire,
upon a tract twelve miles square, one of the best sections of the State, situate in the area
between Manchester, Lowell, Lawrence, and Exeter. Here every farmer cultivated his field of
barley and flax, here every woman had her little wheel, and the article formed the currency
of the place;--notes were given payable in spinning-wheels. Girls were seen beetling the linen
on the grass; and when the harvest over, the men mounted their horses, and with well-filled
saddle-bags threaded the by-roads of the forest to find a market in Boston, Lynn, Salem, or
Newburyport. Fortunes were thus accumulated and a flourishing academy and two Presbyterian
societies are now sustained by funds thus acquired by the Pinkerton family. But as the wages
of girls gradually rose from two shillings to two dollars per week with the invention of the
cotton-gin, the power-loom, and the spinning-jenny, the culture of flax was gradually abandoned,
the seat of manufactures removed from the hills to the waterfalls, and the flax-fields converted
into market-gardens or milk-farms. The town of Derry, once the great seat of New-England manufactures,
is now principally distinguished for the Stark, Rogers, and Reed it gave to the French War
and the Revolution, for the Bells, Dinsmores, Wilsons, and Pattersons it has given to the halls
of legislation, and the McKeens, McGregors, Morisons, and Nesmiths it has furnished to commerce
or the Church.

At the present rates of labor, the culture of flax cannot be revived in this region until the
mode of curing and dressing it is cheapened; and there is reason to hope that this revolution
is at hand.

At the present moment flax is raised both in India and Ohio for the seed alone. An acre of
ripened flax yields from ten to twenty bushels of seed, and each bushel affords nearly or quite
two gallons of linseed-oil. The well-ripened seed is most prolific in oil.

It has been supposed by some that flax exhausts the soil. It is undoubtedly true that it does
best under a rotation of crops, and that the ingredients it withdraws from the soil should
be restored to preserve its fertility. But the reduction of the plant to ashes shows that its
chemical components can be restored at a cost of three dollars per acre, while the properties
withdrawn by the seed can be easily supplied by returning in other fertilizers the equivalent
for half a ton of flax-seed. If the oil-cake be consumed upon the farm, little more than the
above and its product in manure will be required.

The ashes of the flax-plant have been analyzed. Dr. Royle, of England, a distinguished writer
upon fibrous plants, assures us that the following compound will supply to one acre all that
the plant requires, and leave the land as fertile as before the flax was gathered:--

                              lbs.      s.    d.
  Muriate of Potash            30   cost 2     6

It has been ascertained by the microscope that wool, cotton, hemp, jute, and flax are composed
of minute fibres, each of which forms a hollow tube, and there is a close resemblance between
the tubes of each,--the tube of the cotton, however, collapsing as it ripens. These tubes in
the jute and flax are closely cemented together, and the term Fibrilia has been applied to
fibres of the plant when reduced to a short staple like cotton. The process for effecting this
result is very accurately described in a work just published, entitled "Fibrilia." The patentees
of this invention claim that their process, in the space of twenty-four hours, converts the
flax and tow, as they come from the threshing-mill, into an article which may be spun and woven
by the same machinery as cotton. The article produced and lately exhibited at public meetings
resembles cotton in its appearance and qualities, with the advantage that it wastes less in
the manufacture, has more lustre, and receives a superior color. The patentees and their friends
further claim that this cotton can be raised in all temperate latitudes, at the rate of four
to eight hundred pounds per acre, and profess within the past year to have manufactured twelve
thousand pounds.

These statements have been confidently made at public meetings in the State House of Massachusetts,
and it is understood that a mill containing one hundred looms, half of which are now in operation,
has been erected at Roxbury, under the direction of gentlemen who are familiar with the manufacture.
Should the same results be obtained on a large scale which have attended the manufacture of
the first few bales, the first step in a great revolution will be effected.

By the process of Mr. S.M. Allen of Boston, the great outlay of labor which has usually attended
the culture and preparation of flax is avoided. When the plant has attained its full height
of twenty to thirty inches, and its seed is ripened, it is harvested like grass with a mowing-machine,
dried like hay or oats in the field, and then carried to the threshing-mill. After the seed
is separated, the stalk is transferred to a patent brake, moved by two or four horses, and
costing from three to four hundred dollars. This machine is composed of several sets of fluted
iron rollers, between which the stalk passes from one set to another, the rollers gradually
diminishing in size, but increasing in rapidity of motion, by means of which the woody texture
of the plant is effectually broken and separated. The filaments are then carried through a
coarse card or picker. The shives are thus separated, and two tons of stalks reduced to half
a ton of linten, which may be either taken at once to the retort or baled for shipment. When
the flax is thus reduced by the farmer to linten, the article is reputed to be worth to the
manufacturer four cents a pound, or at least twenty dollars for the product of an acre yielding
a single ton of flax-straw.

According to this statement the farmer would realize from his crop at least as follows:--

  Estimated value of seed, 14 bushels,
  at $1.25                                   $17.50
  Estimated value of 500 lbs. of linten,
  at 4 cts.                                   20.00
  Estimated value of 3/4 of a ton of shives
  from unrotted stems, valuable for
  cattle, at $8.00 per ton                     6.00

  Produce of an acre                         $43.50

And this produce would be realized with little more labor than a crop of oats or wheat, returning
less than twenty-five dollars to the acre. Unless the soil should be foul, no weeding would
be required, while the breaking would cost little more than a second threshing, and a second
crop of turnips can be taken from the same soil.

From the patent brake and the picker the linten is carried to a retort, which may hold from
five hundred to three thousand pounds of fibre,--the capacity of one hundred cubic feet being
required for each thousand pounds; and the retort, which may be made from boiler-plates, costs
from three hundred to fifteen hundred dollars. Here the linten is put into a hot bath of air
forced through heated water, and thus charged with moisture, which softens the filaments and
diminishes the cohesion of the fibres. After this air-bath, pure water of the temperature of
one hundred and forty to one hundred and sixty degrees is admitted into the retort, and the
linten is immersed in it for five or six hours.

After this steeping process is completed, the water is let off from below, and pure water admitted
from above under pressure, until the color begins to change; the fibre is then steeped for
three or four hours in a weak solution of soda-ash; the alkali is washed out by the admission
of pure water alternating with steam, and, if necessary to complete the bleaching, a weak solution
of chlorine is applied. All this may be effected without removing the linten from the retort.
The product is then dried as in ordinary drying-rooms.

When dried, it is carried again through a set of cards, and a piece of machinery termed a railway-head,
with positive draught, which can be set so as to give any length of staple, and to present
the flax-cotton thus produced in any form required for spinning, either separately or mixed
with cotton or wool, and thus adapted to the machinery used in the manufacture of either of
these articles. The cost of this process, from the brake to the final production of the cotton,
is set by the patentee, after leaving him a fair profit, at three cents per pound of cotton;
and if we add this to the cost of the linten, and allow for freight and storage, the entire
cost of the fibrilia is but eight cents per pound, or two-thirds of the present price of middling
cotton.

The idea of modifying the filaments of flax and hemp so as to convert them into cotton is by
no means a new one. As long ago as 1747 it was proposed to convert flax into cotton by boiling
it in a solution of caustic potash, and subsequently washing it with soap; and in 1775 Lady
Moira, aided by T.B. Bailey, actually converted some refuse flax into cotton by boiling it
in alkali. The result was, that the fibres seemed to be set at liberty from each other; after
which it was carded on cotton cards, spun, and woven as cotton.

The Chevalier Claussen, as recently as 1850, claimed to have discovered the process, and actually
took out a patent; but his invention, which consisted in boiling the cut and crushed stems
of the flax in a solution of caustic soda, turned out a failure,--the cutting, crushing, and
boiling processes proving alike defective.

New discoveries are the result of repeated trials; perseverance usually prevails; and if States
are to secede at pleasure and withhold their cotton, and no other good uses can be found for
flax or hemp, why should not their fibres secede also,--be set at liberty and resolve themselves
into a cotton state?

We might pass from the fibrous plants, and the metamorphosis of flax into cotton, to the Pinna,
whose fibres grow in the sea on the coast of Italy, and anchor the huge shell-fish to the rock
or the sand. These fibres are brought up by divers, and woven into beautiful fabrics. We might
repeat the tale of the crab which lives with this shell-fish, and apprises his blind housekeeper
of the approach of danger,--a tale confirmed by ancient and modern naturalists,--for there
are strange doings in the sea as well as upon the land. We might also dilate upon China grass,
which is manufactured in the East into delicate fabrics. But our limits compel us to defer
these topics.

NAT TURNER'S INSURRECTION. The insurrection revived in one agonizing reminiscence all the distresses
of Gabriel's Revolt, thirty years before; and its memory endures still fresh, now that thirty
added years have brought the more formidable presence of General Butler. It is by no means
impossible that the very children or even confederates of Nat Turner may be included at this
moment among the contraband articles of Fort Monroe. Compare this with ordinary wars; compare
it with the annals of the French Revolution. No one, perhaps, has yet painted the wrongs of
the French populace so terribly as Dickens in his "Tale of Two Cities"; yet what man, conversant
with slave-biographies, can read that narrative without feeling it weak beside the provocations
to which fugitive slaves testify? It is something for human nature that these desperate insurgents
revenged such wrongs by death alone. Even that fearful penalty was to be inflicted only till
the object was won. It was admitted in the "Richmond Enquirer" of the time, that "indiscriminate
massacre was not their intention, after they obtained foothold, and was resorted to in the
first instance to strike terror and alarm. Women and children would afterwards have been spared,
and men also who ceased to resist." The few who remained together agreed to separate for a
few hours to see if anything could be done to revive the insurrection, and meet again that
evening at their original rendezvous. But they never reached it. Whether in any case they were
also the sons of those masters is a point ignored; but from the fact that three out of the
seven were at first reported as being white men by several different witnesses,--the whole
number being correctly given, and the statement therefore probably authentic,--one must suppose
that there was an admixture of patrician blood in some of these conspirators. This "noble-minded
African," at least, estimated his own desert at a high standard: he demanded freedom,--and
obtained it. On September 30th a minute account of his capture appeared in the newspapers,
but it was wholly false.

This last statement merits remark. There would he no evidence that this formidable man was
not favored during his imprisonment with that full measure of luxury which slave-jails afford
to slaves, but for a rumor which arose after the execution, that he was compelled to sell his
body in advance, for purposes of dissection, in exchange for food. But it does not appear probable,
from the known habits of Southern anatomists, that any such bargain could have been needed.
For in the circular of the South Carolina Medical School for that very year I find this remarkable
suggestion:--"Some advantages of a peculiar character are connected with this institution.
What a convenience, to possess for scientific purposes a class of population sufficiently human
to be dissected, but not human enough to be supposed to take offence at it! And as the same
arrangement may be supposed to have existed in Virginia, Nat Turner would hardly have gone
through the formality of selling his body for food to those who claimed its control at any rate.

CONCERNING VEAL:

A DISCOURSE OF IMMATURITY.

The man who, in his progress through life, has listened with attention to the conversation
of human beings, who has carefully read the writings of the best English authors, who has made
himself well acquainted with the history and usages of his native land, and who has meditated
much on all he has seen and read, must have been led to the firm conviction that by VEAL those
who speak the English language intend to denote the flesh of calves, and that by a calf is
intended an immature ox or cow. A calf is a creature in a temporary and progressive stage of
its being. It will not always be a calf; if it live long enough, it will assuredly cease to
be a calf. And if impatient man, arresting the creature at that stage, should consign it to
the hands of him whose business it is to convert the sentient animal into the impassive and
unconscious meat, the nutriment which the creature will afford will be nothing more than immature
beef. There may be many qualities of Veal; the calf which yields it may die at very different
stages in its physical and moral development; but provided only it die as a calf,--provided
only that its meat can fitly be styled Veal,--this will be characteristic of it, that the meat
shall be immature meat. It may be very good, very nutritious and palatable; some people may
like it better than Beef, and may feed upon it with the liveliest satisfaction; but when it
is fairly and deliberately put to us, it must be admitted, even by such as like Veal the best,
that Veal is but an immature production of Nature. I take Veal, therefore, as the emblem of
IMMATURITY,--of that which is now in a stage out of which it must grow,--of that which, as
time goes on, will grow older, will probably grow better, will certainly grow very different.
That is what I mean by Veal.

And now, my reader and friend, you will discern the subject about which I trust we are to have
some pleasant and not unprofitable thought together. You will readily believe that my subject
is not that material Veal which may be beheld and purchased in the butchers' shops. I am not
now to treat of its varied qualities, of the sustenance which it yields, of the price at which
it may be procured, or of the laws according to which that price rises and falls. I am not
going to take you to the green fields in which the creature which yielded the Veal was fed,
or to discourse of the blossoming hawthorn hedges from whose midst it was reft away. Neither
shall I speak of the rustic life, the toils, cares, and fancies of the farm-house near which
it spent its brief lifetime. The Veal of which I intend to speak is Moral Veal, or (to speak
with entire accuracy) Veal Intellectual, Moral, and Aesthetical. By Veal I understand the immature
productions of the human mind,--immature compositions, immature opinions, feelings, and tastes.
I wish to think of the work, the views, the fancies, the emotions, which are yielded by the
human soul in its immature stages,--while the calf (so to speak) is only growing into the ox,--while
the clever boy, with his absurd opinions and feverish feelings and fancies, is developing into
the mature and sober-minded man. And if I could but rightly set out the thoughts which have
at many different times occurred to me on this matter, if one could catch and fix the vague
glimpses and passing intuitions of solid unchanging truth, if the subject on which one has
thought long and felt deeply were always that on which one could write best, and could bring
out to the sympathy of others what a man himself has felt, what an excellent essay this would
be! But it will not be so; for, as I try to grasp the thoughts I would set out, they melt away
and elude me. It is like trying to catch and keep the rainbow hues you have seen the sunshine
cast upon the spray of a waterfall, when you try to catch the tone, the thoughts, the feelings,
the atmosphere of early youth.

There can be no question at all as to the fact, that clever young men and women, when their
minds begin to open, when they begin to think for themselves, do pass through a stage of mental
development which they by-and-by quite outgrow, and entertain opinions and beliefs, and feel
emotions, on which afterwards they look back with no sympathy or approval. This is a fact as
certain as that a calf grows into an ox, or that veal, if spared to grow, will become beef.
But no analogy between the material and the moral must be pushed too far. There are points
of difference between material and moral Veal. A calf knows it is a calf. It may think itself
bigger and wiser than an ox, but it knows it is not an ox. And if it be a reasonable calf,
modest, and free from prejudice, it is well aware that the joints it will yield after its demise
will be very different from those of the stately and well-consolidated ox which ruminates in
the rich pasture near it. But the human boy often thinks he is a man, and even more than a
man. He fancies that his mental stature is as big and as solid as it will ever become. He fancies
that his mental productions--the poems and essays he writes, the political and social views
he forms, the moods of feeling with which he regards things--are just what they may always
be, just what they ought always to be. If spared in this world, and if he be one of those whom
years make wiser, the day comes when he looks back with amazement and shame on those early
mental productions. He discerns now how immature, absurd, and extravagant they were,--in brief,
how Vealy. But at the time, he had not the least idea that they were so. He had entire confidence
in himself,--not a misgiving as to his own ability and wisdom. You, clever young student of
eighteen years old, when you wrote your prize essay, fancied that in thought and style it was
very like Macaulay,--and not Macaulay in that stage of Vealy brilliancy in which he wrote his
essay on Milton, not Macaulay the fairest and most promising of calves, but Macaulay the stateliest
and most beautiful of oxen. Well, read over your essay now at thirty, and tell us what you
think of it. And you, clever, warm-hearted, enthusiastic young preacher of twenty-four, wrote
your sermon; it was very ingenious, very brilliant in style, and you never thought but that
it would be felt by mature-minded Christian people as suiting their case, as true to their
inmost experience. You could not see why you might not preach as well as a man of forty. And
if people in middle age had complained, that, eloquent as your preaching was, they found it
suited them better and profited them more to listen to the plainer instructions of some good
man with gray hair, you would not have understood their feeling, and you might perhaps have
attributed it to many motives rather than the true one. But now at five-and-thirty, find out
the yellow manuscript, and read it carefully over; and I will venture to say, that, if you
were a really clever and eloquent young man, writing in an ambitious and rhetorical style,
and prompted to do so by the spontaneous fervor of your heart and readiness of your imagination,
you will feel now little sympathy even with the literary style of that early composition,--you
will see extravagance and bombast, where once you saw only eloquence and graphic power. And
as for the graver and more important matter of the thought of the discourse, I think you will
be aware of a certain undefinable shallowness and crudity. Your growing experience has borne
you beyond it. Somehow you feel it does not come home to you, and suit you as you would wish
it should. It will not do. That old sermon you cannot preach now, till you have entirely recast
and rewritten it. But you had no such notion when you wrote the sermon. You were satisfied
with it. You thought it even better than the discourses of men as clever as yourself, and ten
or fifteen years older. Your case was as though the youthful calf should walk beside the sturdy
ox, and think itself rather bigger.

Let no clever young reader fancy, from what has been said, that I am about to make an onslaught
upon clever young men. I remember too distinctly how bitter, and indeed ferocious, I used to
feel, about eleven or twelve years ago, when I heard men of more than middle age and less than
middling ability speak with contemptuous depreciation of the productions and doings of men
considerably their juniors, and vastly their superiors,--describing them as boys, and as clever
lads, with looks of dark malignity. There are few more disgusting sights than the envy and
jealousy of their juniors, which may be seen in various malicious, commonplace old men; as
there is hardly a more beautiful and pleasing sight than the old man hailing and counselling
and encouraging the youthful genius which he knows far surpasses his own. And I, my young friend
of two-and-twenty, who, relatively to you, may be regarded as old, am going to assume no preposterous
airs of superiority. I do not claim to be a bit wiser than you; all I claim is to be older.
I have outgrown your stage; but I was once such as you, and all my sympathies are with you
yet. But it is a difficulty in the way of the essayist, and, indeed, of all who set out opinions
which they wish to be received and acted on by their fellow-creatures, that they seem, by the
very act of offering advice to others, to claim to be wiser and better than those whom they
advise. But in reality it is not so. The opinions of the essayist or of the preacher, if deserving
of notice at all, are so because of their inherent truth, and not because he expresses them.
Estimate them for yourself, and give them the weight which you think their due. And be sure
of this, that the writer, if earnest and sincere, addressed all he said to himself as much
as to any one else. This is the thing which redeems all didactic writing or speaking from the
charge of offensive assumption and self-assertion. It is not for the preacher, whether of moral
or religious truth, to address his fellows as outside sinners, worse than himself, and needing
to be reminded of that of which he does not need to be reminded. No, the earnest preacher preaches
to himself as much as to any in the congregation; it is from the picture ever before him in
his own weak and wayward heart that he learns to reach and describe the hearts of others, if,
indeed, he do so at all. And it is the same with lesser things.

It is curious and it is instructive to remark how heartily men, as they grow towards middle
age, despise themselves as they were a few years since. It is a bitter thing for a man to confess
that he is a fool; but it costs little effort to declare that he was a fool, a good while ago.
Indeed, a tacit compliment to his present self is involved in the latter confession: it suggests
the reflection, what progress he has made, and how vastly he has improved, since then. When
a man informs us that he was a very silly fellow in the year 1851, it is assumed that he is
not a very silly fellow in the year 1861. It is as when the merchant with ten thousand a year,
sitting at his sumptuous table, and sipping his '41 claret, tells you how, when he came as
a raw lad from the country, he used often to have to go without his dinner. He knows that the
plate, the wine, the massively elegant apartment, the silent servants, so alert, yet so impassive,
will appear to join in chorus with the obvious suggestion, "You see he has not to go without
his dinner now!" Did you ever, when twenty years old, look back at the diary you kept when
you were sixteen,--or when twenty-five, at the diary you kept when twenty,--or at thirty, at
the diary you kept when twenty-five? Was not your feeling a singular mixture of humiliation
and self-complacency? What extravagant, silly stuff it seemed that you had thus written five
years before! What Veal! and, oh, what a calf he must have been who wrote it! It is a difficult
question, to which the answer cannot be elicited, Who is the greatest fool in this world? But
every candid and sensible man of middle age knows thoroughly well the answer to the question,
Who was the greatest fool that he himself ever knew? And after all, it is your diary, especially
if you were wont to introduce into it poetical remarks and moral reflections, that will mainly
help you to the humiliating conclusion. Other things, some of which I have already named, will
point in the same direction. Look at the prize essays you wrote when you were a boy at school;
look even at your earlier prize essays written at college (though of these last I have something
to say hereafter); look at the letters you wrote home when away at school or even at college,
especially if you were a clever boy, trying to write in a graphic and witty fashion; and if
you have reached sense at last, (which some, it may be remarked, never do,) I think you will
blush even through the unblushing front of manhood, and think what a terrific, unutterable,
conceited, intolerable blockhead you were. It is not till people attain somewhat mature years
that they can rightly understand the wonderful forbearance their parents must have shown in
listening patiently to the frightful nonsense they talked and wrote. I have already spoken
of sermons. If you go early into the Church, say at twenty-three or twenty-four, and write
sermons regularly and diligently, you know what landmarks they will be of your mental progress.
The first runnings of the stream are turbid, but it clears itself into sense and taste month
by month and year by year. You wrote many sermons in your first year or two; you preached them
with entire confidence in them, and they did really keep up the attention of the congregation
in a remarkable way. You accumulate in a box a store of that valuable literature and theology,
and when by-and-by you go to another parish, you have a comfortable feeling that you have a
capital stock to go on with. You think that any Monday morning, when you have the prospect
of a very busy week, or when you feel very weary, you may resolve that you shall write no sermon
that week, but just go and draw forth one from the box. I have already said what you will probably
find, even if you draw forth a discourse which cost much labor. You cannot use it as it stands.
Possibly it may be structural and essential Veal: the whole framework of thought may be immature.
Possibly it may be Veal only in style; and by cutting out a turgid sentence here and there,
and, above all, by cutting out all the passages which you thought particularly eloquent, the
discourse may do yet. But even then you cannot give it with much confidence. Your mind can
yield something better than that now. I imagine how a fine old orange-tree, that bears oranges
with the thinnest possible skin and with no pips, juicy and rich, might feel that it has outgrown
the fruit of its first years, when the skin was half an inch thick, the pips innumerable, and
the eatable portion small and poor. It is with a feeling such as that that you read over your
early sermon. Still, mingling with the sense of shame, there is a certain satisfaction. You
have not been standing still; you have been getting on. And we always like to think that.

What is it that makes intellectual Veal? What are the things about a composition which stamp
it as such? Well, it is a certain character in thought and style hard to define, but strongly
felt by such as discern its presence at all. It is strongly felt by professors reading the
compositions of their students, especially the compositions of the cleverest students. It is
strongly felt by educated folk of middle age, in listening to the sermons of young pulpit orators,
especially of such as think for themselves, of such as aim at a high standard of excellence,
of such as have in them the makings of striking and eloquent preachers. Dull and stupid fellows
never deviate into the extravagance and absurdity which I specially understand by Veal. They
plod along in a humdrum manner; there is no poetry in their soul,--none of those ambitious
stirrings which lead the man who has in him the true spark of genius to try for grand things
and incur severe and ignominious tumbles. A heavy dray-horse, walking along the road, may possibly
advance at a very lagging pace, or may even stand still; but whatever he may do, he is not
likely to jump violently over the hedge, or to gallop off at twenty-five miles an hour. It
must be a thoroughbred who will go wrong in that grand fashion. And there are intellectual
absurdities and extravagances which hold out hopeful promise of noble doings yet: the eagle,
which will breast the hurricane yet, may meet various awkward tumbles before he learns the
fashion in which to use those iron wings. But the substantial goose, which probably escapes
those tumbles in trying to fly, will never do anything very magnificent in the way of flying.
The man who in his early days writes in a very inflated and bombastic style will gradually
sober down into good sense and accurate taste, still retaining something of liveliness and
eloquence. But expect little of the man who as a boy was always sensible, and never bombastic.
He will grow awfully dry. He is sure to fall into the unpardonable sin of tiresomeness. The
rule has exceptions; but the earliest productions of a man of real genius are almost always
crude, flippant, and affectedly smart, or else turgid and extravagant in a high degree. Witness
Mr. Disraeli; witness Sir E.B. Lytton; witness even Macaulay. The man who as mere boy writes
something very sound and sensible will probably never become more than a dull, sensible, commonplace
man. Many people can say, as they bethink themselves of their old college companions, that
those who wrote with good sense and good taste at twenty have mostly settled down into the
dullest and baldest of prosers; while such as dealt in bombastic flourishes and absurd ambitiousness
of style have learned, as time went on, to prune their early luxuriances, while still retaining
something of raciness, interest, and ornament.

I have been speaking very generally of the characteristics of Veal in composition. It is difficult
to give any accurate description of it that shall go into minuter details. Of course it is
easy to think of little external marks of the beast,--that is, the calf. It is Veal in style,
when people, writing prose, think it a fine thing to write o'er instead of over, ne'er instead
of never, poesie instead of poetry, and methinks under any circumstances whatsoever. References
to the heart are generally of the nature of Veal; also allusions to the mysterious throbbings
and yearnings of our nature. The word grand has of late come to excite a strong suspicion of
Veal; and when I read the other day in a certain poem something about a great grand man, I
concluded that the writer of that poem was meanwhile a great grand calf. The only case in which
the words may properly be used together is in speaking of your great-grandfather. To talk about
mine affections, meaning my affections, is Veal; and mine bonnie love was decided Veal, though
it was written by Charlotte Bronté. Wife mine is Veal, though it stands in "The Caxtons." I
should rather like to see the man who in actual life is accustomed to address his spouse in
that fashion. To say Not, oh, never shall we do so and so is outrageous Veal. Sylvan grove
or sylvan vale in ordinary conversation is Veal. The word glorious should be used with caution;
when applied to trees, mountains, or the like, there is a strong suspicion of Veal about it.
But one feels that in saying these things we are not getting at the essence of Veal. Veal in
thought is essential Veal, and it is very hard to define. Beyond extravagant language, beyond
absurd fine things, it lies in a certain lack of reality and sobriety of sense and view,--in
a certain indefinable jejuneness in the mental fare provided, which makes mature men feel that
somehow it does not satisfy their cravings. You know what I mean better than I can express
it. You have seen and heard a young preacher, with a rosy face and an unlined brow, preaching
about the cares and trials of life. Well, you just feel at once he knows nothing about them.
You feel that all this is at second-hand. He is saying all this because he supposes it is the
right thing to say. Give me the pilot to direct me who has sailed through the difficult channel
many a time himself. Give me the friend to sympathize with me in sorrow who has felt the like.
There is a hollowness, a certain want, in the talk about much tribulation of the very cleverest
man who has never felt any great sorrow at all. The great force and value of all teaching lie
in the amount of personal experience which is embodied in it. You feel the difference between
the production of a wonderfully clever boy and of a mature man, when you read the first canto
of "Childe Harold," and then read "Philip van Artevelde." I do not say but that the boy's production
may have a liveliness and interest beyond the man's. Veal is in certain respects superior to
Beef, though Beef is best on the whole. I have heard Vealy preachers whose sermons kept up
breathless attention. From the first word to the last of a sermon which was unquestionable
Veal, I have witnessed an entire congregation listen with that audible hush you know. It was
very different, indeed, from the state of matters when a humdrum old gentleman was preaching,
every word spoken by whom was the maturest sense, expressed in words to which the most fastidious
taste could have taken no exception; but then the whole thing was sleepy: it was a terrible
effort to attend. In the case of the Veal there was no effort at all. I defy you to help attending.
But then you sat in pain. Every second sentence there was some outrageous offence against good
taste; every third statement was absurd, or overdrawn, or almost profane. You felt occasional
thrills of pure disgust and horror, and you were in terror what might come next. One thing
which tended to carry all this off was the manifest confidence and earnestness of the speaker.
He did not think it Veal that he was saying. And though great consternation was depicted on
the faces of some of the better-educated people in church, you could see that a very considerable
part of the congregation did not think it Veal either. There can be no doubt, my middle-aged
friend, if you could but give your early sermons now with the confidence and fire of the time
when you wrote them, they would make a deep impression on many people yet. But it is simply
impossible for you to give them; and if you should force yourself some rainy Sunday to preach
one of them, you would give it with such a sense of its errors, and with such an absence of
corresponding feeling, that it would fall very flat and dead. Your views are maturing; your
taste is growing fastidious; the strong things you once said you could not bring yourself to
say now. If you could preach those old sermons, there is no doubt they would go down with the
mass of uncultivated folk,--go down better than your mature and reasonable ones. We have all
known such cases as that of a young preacher who, at twenty-five, in his days of Veal, drew
great crowds to the church at which he preached, and who at thirty-five, being a good deal
tamed and sobered, and in the judgment of competent judges vastly improved, attracted no more
than a respectable congregation. A very great and eloquent preacher lately lamented to me the
uselessness of his store of early discourses. If he could but get rid of his present standard
of what is right and good in thought and language, and preach them with the enchaining fire
with which he preached them once! For many hearers remain immature, though the preacher has
matured. Young people are growing up, and there are people whose taste never ripens beyond
the enjoyment of Veal. There is a period in the mental development of those who will be ablest
and maturest, at which Vealy thought and language are accepted as the best. Veal will be highly
appreciated by sympathetic calves; and the greatest men, with rare exceptions, are calves in
youth, while many human beings are calves forever. And here I may remark, as something which
has afforded me consolation on various occasions within the last year, that it seems unquestionable
that sermons which are utterly revolting to people of taste and sense have done much good to
large masses of those people in whom common sense is most imperfectly developed, and in whom
taste is not developed at all; and accordingly, wherever one is convinced of the sincerity
of the individuals, however foolish and uneducated, who go about pouring forth those violent,
exaggerated, and all but blasphemous discourses of which I have read accounts in the newspapers,
one would humbly hope that a Power which works by many means would bring about good even through
an instrumentality which it is hard to contemplate without some measure of horror. The impression
produced by most things in this world is relative to the minds on which the impression is produced.
A coarse ballad, deficient in rhyme and rhythm, and only half decent, will keep up the attention
of a rustic group to whom you might read from "In Memoriam" in vain. A waistcoat of glaring
scarlet will be esteemed by a country bumpkin a garment every way preferable to one of aspect
more subdued. A nigger melody will charm many a one who would yawn at Beethoven. You must have
rough means to move rough people. The outrageous revival-orator may do good to people to whom
Bishop Wilberforce or Dr. Caird might preach to no purpose; and if real good be done, by whatever
means, all right-minded people should rejoice to hear of it.

       *       *       *       *       *

And this leads to an important practical question, on which men at different periods of life
will never agree. When shall thought be regarded as mature? Is there a standard by which we
may ascertain beyond question whether a composition be Veal or Beef? I sigh for fixity and
assurance in matters aesthetical. It is vexatious that what I think very good my friend Smith
thinks very bad. It is vexatious that what strikes me as supreme and unapproachable excellence
strikes another person, at least as competent to form an opinion, as poor. And I am angry with
myself when I feel that I honestly regard as inflated commonplace and mystical jargon what
a man as old and (let us say) nearly as wise as myself thinks the utterance of a prophet. You
know how, when you contemplate the purchase of a horse, you lead him up to the measuring-bar,
and there ascertain the precise number of hands and inches which he stands. How have I longed
for the means of subjecting the mental stature of human beings to an analogous process of measurement!
Oh for some recognized and unerring gauge of mental calibre! It would be a grand thing, if
somewhere in a very conspicuous position--say on the site of the National Gallery at Charing
Cross--there were a pillar erected, graduated by some new Fahrenheit, on which we could measure
the height of a man's mind. How delightful it would be to drag up some pompous pretender who
passes off at once upon himself and others as a profound and able man, and make him measure
his height upon that pillar, and understand beyond all cavil what a pigmy he is! And how pleasant,
too, it would be to bring up some man of unacknowledged genius, and make the world see the
reach of his intellectual stature! The mass of educated people, even, are so incapable of forming
any estimate of a man's ability, that it would be a blessing, if men could be sent out into
the world with the stamp upon them, telling what are their weight and value, plain for every
one to see. But of course there are many ways in which a book, sermon, or essay may be bad
without being Vealy. It may be dull, stupid, illogical, and the like, and yet have nothing
of boyishness about it. It may be insufferably bad, yet quite mature. Beef may be bad, and
yet undoubtedly Beef. And the question now is, not so much whether there be a standard of what
is in a literary sense good or bad, as whether there be a standard of what is Veal and what
is Beef. And there is a great difficulty here. Is a thing to be regarded as mature, when it
suits your present taste, when it is approved by your present deliberate judgment? For your
taste is always changing: your standard is not the same for three successive years of your
early youth. The Veal you now despise you thought Beef when you wrote it. And so, too, with
the productions of other men. You cannot read now without amazement the books which used to
enchant you as a child. I remember when I used to read Hervey's "Meditations" with great delight.
That was when I was about five years old. A year or two later I greatly affected Macpherson's
translation of Ossian. It is not so very long since I felt the liveliest interest in Tupper's
"Proverbial Philosophy." Let me confess that I retain a kindly feeling towards it yet; and
that I am glad to see that some hundreds of thousands of readers appear to be still in the
stage out of which I passed some years since. Yes, as you grow older, your taste changes: it
becomes more fastidious; and especially you come to have always less toleration for sentimental
feeling and for flights of fancy. And besides this gradual and constant progression, which
holds on uniformly year after year, there are changes in mood and taste sometimes from day
to day and from hour to hour. The man who did a very silly thing thought it was a wise thing
when he did it. He sees the matter differently in a little while. On the evening after the
Battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington wrote a certain letter. History does not record
its matter or style. But history does record, that some years afterwards the Duke paid a hundred
guineas to get it back again,--and that, on getting it, he instantly burned it, exclaiming,
that, when he wrote it, he must have been the greatest idiot on the face of the earth. Doubtless,
if we had seen that letter, we should have heartily coincided in the sentiment of the hero.
He was an idiot when he wrote it, but he did not think that he was one. I think, however, that
there is a standard of sense and folly, and that there is a point at which Veal is Veal no
more. But I do not believe that thought can justly be called mature only when it has become
such as to suit the taste of some desperately dry old gentleman, with as much feeling as a
log of wood, and as much imagination as an oyster. I know how intolerant some dull old fogies
are of youthful fire and fancy. I shall not be convinced that any discourse is puerile because
it is pronounced such by the venerable Dr. Dryasdust. I remember that the venerable man has
written many pages, possibly abundant in sound sense, but which no mortal could read, and to
which no mortal could listen. I remember, that, though that not very amiable individual has
outlived such wits as he once had, he has not outlived the unbecoming emotions of envy and
jealousy; and he retains a strong tendency to evil-speaking and slandering. You told me, unamiable
individual, how disgusted you were at hearing a friend of mine, who is one of the best preachers
in Britain, preach one of his finest sermons. Perhaps you really were disgusted: there is such
a thing as casting pearls before swine, who will not appreciate them highly. But you went on
to give an account of what the great preacher said; and though I know you are extremely stupid,
you are not quite so stupid as to have actually fancied that the great preacher said what you
reported that he said: you were well aware that you were grossly misrepresenting him. And when
I find malice and insincerity in one respect, I am ready to suspect them in another: and I
venture to doubt whether you were disgusted. Possibly you were only ferocious at finding yourself
so unspeakably excelled. But even if you had been really disgusted, and even if you were a
clever man, and even if you were above the suspicion of jealousy, I should not think that my
friend's noble discourse was puerile because you thought it so. It is not when the warm feelings
of earlier days are dried up into a cold, time-worn cynicism, that I think a man has become
the best judge of the products of the human brain and heart. It is a noble thing when a man
grows old retaining something of youthful freshness and fervor. It is a fine thing to ripen
without shrivelling,-- to reach the calmness of age, yet keep the warm heart and ready sympathy
of youth. Show me such a man as that, and I shall be content to bow to his decision whether
a thing be Veal or not. But as such men are not found very frequently, I should suggest it
as an approximation to a safe criterion, that a thing may be regarded as mature when it is
deliberately and dispassionately approved by an educated man of good ability and above thirty
years of age. No doubt a man of fifty may hold that fifty is the age of sound taste and sense;
and a youth of twenty-three may maintain that he is as good a judge of human doings now as
he will ever be. I do not claim to have proposed an infallible standard. I give you my present
belief, being well aware that it is very likely to alter.

It is not desirable that one's taste should become too fastidious, or that natural feeling
should be refined away. And a cynical young man is bad, but a cynical old one is a great deal
worse. The cynical young man is probably shamming; he is a humbug, not a cynic. But the old
man probably is a cynic, as heartless as he seems. And without thinking of cynicism, real or
affected, let us remember, that, though the taste ought to be refined, and daily refining,
it ought not to be refined beyond being practically serviceable. Let things be good, but not
too good to be workable. It is expedient that a cart for conveying coals should be of neat
and decent appearance. Let the shafts be symmetrical, the boards well-planed, the whole strong,
yet not clumsy; and over the whole let the painter's skill induce a hue rosy as beauty's cheek,
or dark-blue as her eye. All that is well; and while the cart will carry its coals satisfactorily,
it will stand a good deal of rough usage, and it will please the eye of the rustic who sits
in it on an empty sack and whistles as it moves along. But it would be highly inexpedient to
make that cart of walnut of the finest grain and marking, and to have it French-polished. It
would be too fine to be of use; and its possessor would fear to scratch it, and would preserve
it as a show, seeking some plainer vehicle to carry his coals. In like manner, do not refine
too much either the products of the mind, or the sensibilities of the taste which is to appreciate
them. I know an amiable professor very different from Dr. Dryasdust. He was a country clergyman,--a
very interesting plain preacher. But when he got his chair, he had to preach a good deal in
the college chapel; and by way of accommodating his discourses to an academic audience, he
rewrote them carefully, rubbed off all the salient points, cooled down whatever warmth was
in them to frigid accuracy, toned down everything striking. The result was that his sermons
became eminently classical and elegant; only they became impossible to attend to, and impossible
to remember; and when you heard the good man preach, you sighed for the rough and striking
heartiness of former days. And we have all heard of such a thing as taste refined to that painful
sensitiveness, that it became a source of torment,--that is, unfitted for common enjoyments
and even for common duties. There was once a great man, let us say at Melipotamus, who never
went to church. A clergyman once, in speaking to a friend of the great man, lamented that the
great man set so bad an example before his humbler neighbors. "How can that man go to church?"
was the reply; "his taste, and his entire critical faculty, are sharpened, to that degree,
that, in listening to any ordinary preacher, he feels outraged and shocked at every fourth
sentence he hears, by its inelegance or its want of logic; and the entire sermon torments him
by its unsymmetrical structure, its want of perspective in the presentment of details, and
its general literary badness." I quite believe that there was a moderate proportion of truth
in the excuse thus urged; and you will probably judge that it would have been better, had the
great man's mind not been brought to so painful a polish.

The mention of dried-up old gentlemen reminds one of a question which has sometimes perplexed
me. Is it Vealy to feel or to show keen emotion? Is it a precious result and indication of
the maturity of the human mind to look as if you felt nothing at all? I have often looked with
wonder, and with a moderate amount of veneration, at a few old gentlemen whom I know well,
who are leading members of a certain legislative and judicial council held in great respect
in a country of which no more need be said. I have beheld these old gentlemen sitting apparently
quite unmoved, when discussions were going on in which I knew they felt a very deep interest,
and when the tide of debate was setting strongly against their peculiar views. There they sat,
impassive as a Red Indian at the stake. I think of a certain man who, while a smart speech
on the other side is being made, retains a countenance expressing actually nothing; he looks
as if he heard nothing, felt nothing, cared for nothing. But when the other man sits down,
he rises to reply. He speaks slowly at first, but every weighty word goes home and tells: he
gathers warmth and rapidity as he goes on, and in a little you become aware that for a few
hundred pounds a year you may sometimes get a man who would have made an Attorney-General or
a Lord-Chancellor; you discern, that, under the appearance of almost stolidity, there was the
sharpest attention watching every word of the argument of the other speaker, and ready to come
down on every weak point in it; and the other speaker is (in a logical sense) pounded to jelly
by a succession of straight-handed hits. Yes, it is a wonderful thing to find a combination
of coolness and earnestness. But I am inclined to believe that the reason why some old gentlemen
look as if they did not care is that in fact they don't care. And there is no particular merit
in looking cool while a question is being discussed, if you really do not mind a rush which
way it may be decided. A keen, unvarying, engrossing regard for one's self is a great safeguard
against over-excitement in regard to all the questions of the day, political, social, and religious.

It is a curious, but certain fact, that clever young men, at that period of their life when
their own likings tend towards Veal, know quite well the difference between Veal and Beef,
and are quite able, when necessary, to produce the latter. The tendency to boyishness of thought
and style may be repressed, when you know you are writing for the perusal of readers with whom
that will not go down. A student of twenty, who has in him great talent, no matter how undue
a supremacy his imagination may meanwhile have, if he be set to producing an essay in Metaphysics
to be read by professors of philosophy, will produce a composition singularly free from any
trace of immaturity. For such a clever youth, though he may have a strong bent towards Veal,
has in him an instinctive perception that it is Veal, and a keen sense of what will and will
not do for the particular readers he has to please. Go, you essayist who carried off a host
of university honors, and read over now the prize essays you wrote at twenty-one or twenty-two.
I think the thing that will mainly strike you will be, how very mature these compositions are,--how
ingenious, how judicious, how free from extravagance, how quietly and accurately and even felicitously
expressed. They are not Veal. And yet you know that several years after you wrote them you
were still writing a great deal which was Veal beyond all question. But then a clever youth
can produce material to any given standard; and you wrote the essays not to suit your own taste,
but to suit what you intuitively knew was the taste of the grave and even smoke-dried professors
who were to read them and sit in judgment on them.

And though it is very fit and right that the academic standard should be an understood one,
and quite different from the popular standard, still it is not enough that a young man should
be able to write to a standard against which he in his heart rebels and protests. It is yet
more important that you should get him to approve and adopt a standard which is accurate, if
not severe. It is quite extraordinary what bombastic and immature sermons are preached in their
first years in the Church by young clergymen who wrote many academic compositions in a style
the most classical. It seems to be essential that a man of feeling and imagination should be
allowed fairly to run himself out. The course apparently is, that the tree should send out
its rank shoots, and then that you should prune them, rather than that by some repressive means
you should prevent the rank shoots coming forth at all. The way to get a high-spirited horse
to be content to stay peaceably in its stall is to allow it to have a tearing gallop, and thus
get out its superfluous nervous excitement and vital spirit. Let the boiler blow off its steam.
All repression is dangerous. And some injudicious folk, instead of encouraging the highly-charged
mind and heart to relieve themselves by blowing off in excited verse and extravagant bombast,
would (so to speak) sit on the safety-valve. Let the bursting spring flow! It will run turbid
at first; but it will clear itself day by day. Let a young man write a vast deal: the more
he writes, the sooner will the Veal be done with. But if a man write very little, the bombast
is not blown off; and it may remain till advanced years. It seems as if a certain quantity
of fustian must be blown off before you reach the good material. I have heard a mercantile
man of fifty read a paper he had written on a social subject. He had written very little save
business letters all his life. And I assure you that his paper was bombastic to a degree that
you would have said was barely tolerable in a youth of twenty. I have seldom listened to Veal
so outrageous. You see he had not worked through it in his youth; and so here it was now. I
have witnessed the like phenomenon in a man who went into the Church at five-and-forty. I heard
him preach one of his earliest sermons, and I have hardly ever heard such boyish rhodomontade.
The imaginations of some men last out in liveliness longer than those of others; and the taste
of some men never becomes perfect; and it is no doubt owing to these things that you find some
men producing Veal so much later in life than others. You will find men who are very turgid
and magniloquent at five-and-thirty, at forty, at fifty. But I attribute the phenomenon in
no small measure to the fact that such men had not the opportunity of blowing off their steam
in youth. Give a man at four-and-twenty two sermons to write a week, and he will very soon
work through his Veal. It is probably because ladies write comparatively so little, that you
find them writing at fifty poetry and prose of the most awfully romantic and sentimental strain.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have been thinking, my friend, as you have doubtless observed, almost exclusively of intellectual
and aesthetical immaturity, and of its products in composition, spoken or written. But combining
with that immaturity, and going very much to affect the character of that Veal, there is moral
immaturity, resulting in views, feelings, and conduct which may be described as Moral Veal.
But, indeed, it is very difficult to distinguish between the different kinds of immaturity,
and to say exactly what in the moods and doings of youth proceeds from each. It is safest to
rest in the general proposition, that, even as the calf yields Veal, so does the immature human
mind yield immature productions. It is a stage which you outgrow, and therefore a stage of
comparative immaturity, in which you read a vast deal of poetry, and repeat much poetry to
yourself when alone, working yourself up thereby to an enthusiastic excitement. And very like
a calf you look, when some one suddenly enters the room in which you are wildly gesticulating
or moodily laughing, and thinking yourself poetical, and, indeed, sublime. The person probably
takes you for a fool; and the best, you can say for yourself is that you are not so great a
fool as you seem to be. Vealy is the period of life in which you filled a great volume with
the verses you loved, and in which you stored your memory, by frequent reading, with many thousands
of lines. All that you outgrow. Fancy a man of fifty having his commonplace book of poetry!
And it will be instructive to turn over the ancient volume, and to see how year by year the
verses copied grew fewer, and finally ceased entirely. I do not say that all growth is progress:
sometimes it is like that of the muscle, which once advanced into manly vigor and usefulness,
but is now ossifying into rigidity. It is well to have fancy and feeling under command: it
is not well to have feeling and fancy dead. That season of life is Vealy in which you are charmed
by the melody of verse, quite apart from its meaning. And there is a season in which that is
so. And it is curious to remark what verses they are that have charmed many men; for they are
often verses in which no one else could have discerned that singular fascination. You may remember
how Robert Burns has recorded that in youth he was enchanted by the melody of two lines of
Addison's,--

  "For though in dreadful whirls we hung,
  High on the broken wave."

Not a remarkable verse, I think. However, it at least presents a pleasant picture. But I remember
well the enchantment which, when twelve years old, I felt in a verse by Mrs. Hemans, which
I can now see presents an excessively disagreeable picture. I saw it not then; and when I used
to repeat that verse, I know it was without the slightest perception of its meaning. You know
the beautiful poem called the "Battle of Morgarten." At least I remember it as beautiful; and
I am not going to spoil my recollection by reading it now. Here is the verse:--

  "Oh! the sun in heaven fierce havoc viewed,
    When the Austrian turned to fly:
  And the brave, in the trampling multitude,
    Had a fearful death to die!"

As I write that verse, (at which the critical reader will smile,) I am aware that Veal has
its hold of me yet. I see nothing of the miserable scene the poet describes; but I hear the
waves murmuring on a distant beach, and I see the hills across the sea, the first sea I ever
beheld; I see the school to which I went daily; I see the class-room, and the place where I
used to sit; I see the faces and hear the voices of my old companions, some dead, one sleeping
in the middle of the great Atlantic, many scattered over distant parts of the world, almost
all far away. Yes, I feel that I have not quite cast off the witchery of the "Battle of Morgarten."
Early associations can give to verse a charm and a hold upon one's heart which no literary
excellence, however high, ever could. Look at the first hymns you learned to repeat, and which
you used to say at your mother's knee; look at the psalms and hymns you remember hearing sung
at church when you were a child: you know how impossible it is for you to estimate these upon
their literary merits. They may be almost doggerel; but not Mr. Tennyson can touch you like
them! The most effective eloquence is that which is mainly done by the mind to which it is
addressed: it is that which touches chords which of themselves yield matchless music; it is
that which wakens up trains of old remembrance, and which wafts around you the fragrance of
the hawthorn that blossomed and withered many long years since. An English stranger would not
think much of the hymns we sing in our Scotch churches: he could not know what many of them
are to us. There is a magic about the words. I can discern, indeed, that some of them are mawkish
in sentiment, faulty in rhyme, and, on the whole, what you would call extremely unfitted to
be sung in public worship, if you were judging of them as new things: but a crowd of associations
which are beautiful and touching gathers round the lines which have no great beauty or pathos
in themselves.

You were in an extremely Vealy condition, when, having attained the age of fourteen, you sent
some verses to the county newspaper, and with simple-hearted elation read them in the corner
devoted to what was termed "Original Poetry." It is a pity you did not preserve the newspapers
in which you first saw yourself in print, and experienced the peculiar sensation which accompanies
that sight. No doubt your verses expressed the gloomiest views of life, and told of the bitter
disappointments you had met in your long intercourse with mankind, and especially with womankind.
And though you were in a flutter of anxiety and excitement to see whether or not your verses
would be printed, your verses probably declared that you had used up life and seen through
it,--that your heart was no longer to be stirred by aught on earth,--and that, in short, you
cared nothing for anything. You could see nothing fine then in being good, cheerful, and happy;
but you thought it a grand thing to be a gloomy man, of a very dark complexion, with blood
on your conscience, upwards of six feet high, and accustomed to wander from land to land, like
Childe Harold. You were extremely Vealy when you used to fancy that you were sure to be a very
great man, and to think how proud your relations would some day be of you, and how you would
come back and excite a great commotion at the place where you used to be a school-boy. And
it is because the world has still left some impressionable spot in your hearts, my readers,
that you still have so many fond associations with "the school-boy spot we ne'er forget, though
we are there forgot." They were Vealy days, though pleasant to remember, my old school-companions,
in which you used to go to the dancing-school, (it was in a gloomy theatre, seldom entered
by actors,) in which you fell in love with several young ladies about eleven years old, and
(being permitted occasionally to select your own partners) made frantic rushes to obtain the
hand of one of the beauties of that small society. Those were the days in which you thought,
that, when you grew up, it would be a very fine thing to be a pirate, bandit, or corsair, rather
than a clergyman, barrister, or the like; even a cheerful outlaw like Robin Hood did not come
up to your views; you would rather have been a man like Captain Kyd, stained with various crimes
of extreme atrocity, which would entirely preclude the possibility of returning to respectable
society, and given to moody laughter in solitary moments. Oh, what truly asinine developments
the human being must go through, before arriving at the stage of common sense! You were very
Vealy, too, when you used to think it a fine thing to astonish people by expressing awful sentiments,--such
as that you thought Mahometans better than Christians, that you would like to be dissected
after death, that you did not care what you got for dinner, that you liked learning your lessons
better than going out to play, that you would rather read Euclid than "Ivanhoe," and the like.
It may be remarked, that this peculiar Vealiness is not confined to youth; I have seen it appearing
very strongly in men with gray hair. Another manifestation of Vealiness, which appears both
in age and youth, is the entertaining a strong belief that kings, noblemen, and baronets are
always in a condition of ecstatic happiness. I have known people pretty far advanced in life,
who not only believed that monarchs must be perfectly happy, but that all who were permitted
to continue in their presence would catch a considerable degree of the mysterious bliss which
was their portion. I have heard a sane man, rather acute and clever in many things, seriously
say, "If a man cannot be happy in the presence of his Sovereign, where can he be happy?"

And yet, absurd and foolish as is Moral Vealiness, there is something fine about it. Many of
the old and dear associations most cherished in human hearts are of the nature of Veal. It
is sad to think that most of the romance of life is unquestionably so. All spooniness, all
the preposterous idolization of some one who is just like anybody else, all love, (in the narrow
sense in which the word is understood by novel-readers,) you feel, when you look back, are
Veal. The young lad and the young girl, whom at a picnic party you have discerned stealing
off under frivolous pretexts from the main body of guests, and sitting on the grass by the
river-side, enraptured in the prosecution of a conversation which is intellectually of the
emptiest, and fancying that they two make all the world, and investing that spot with remembrances
which will continue till they are gray, are (it must in sober sadness be admitted) of the nature
of calves. For it is beyond doubt that they are at a stage which they will outgrow, and on
which they may possibly look back with something of shame. All these things, beautiful as they
are, are no more than Veal. Yet they are fitting and excellent in their time. No, let us not
call them Veal; they are rather like Lamb, which is excellent, though immature. No doubt, youth
is immaturity; and as you outgrow it, you are growing better and wiser: still youth is a fine
thing; and most people would be young again, if they could. How cheerful and light-hearted
is immaturity! How cheerful and lively are the little children even of silent and gloomy men!
It is sad, and it is unnatural, when they are not so. I remember yet, when I was at school,
with what interest and wonder I used to look at two or three boys, about twelve or thirteen
years old, who were always dull, sullen, and unhappy-looking. In those days, as a general rule,
you are never sorrowful without knowing the reason why. You are never conscious of the dull
atmosphere, of the gloomy spirits, of after-time. The youthful machine, bodily and mental,
plays smoothly; the young being is cheery. Even a kitten is very different from a grave old
cat, and a young colt from a horse sobered by the cares and toils of years. And you picture
fine things to yourself in your youthful dreams. I remember a beautiful dwelling I used often
to see, as if from the brow of a great hill. I see the rich valley below, with magnificent
woods and glades, and a broad river reflecting the sunset; and in the midst of the valley,
the vast Saracenic pile, with gilded minarets blazing in the golden light. I have since then
seen many splendid habitations, but none in the least equal to that. I cannot even yet discard
the idea that somewhere in this world there stands that noble palace, and that some day I shall
find it out. You remember also the intense delight with which you read the books that charmed
you then: how you carried off the poem or the tale to some solitary place,--how you sat up
far into the night to read it,--how heartily you believed in all the story, and sympathized
with the people it told of. I wish I could feel now the veneration for the man who has written
a book which I used once to feel. Oh that one could read the old volumes with the old feeling!
Perhaps you have some of them yet, and you remember the peculiar expression of the type in
which they were printed: the pages look at you with the face of an old friend. If you were
then of an observant nature, you will understand how much of the effect of any composition
upon the human mind depends upon the printing, upon the placing of the points, even upon the
position of the sentences on the page. A grand, high-flown, and sentimental climax ought always
to conclude at the bottom of a page. It will look ridiculous, if it ends four or five lines
down from the top of the next page. Somehow there is a feeling as of the difference between
the night before and the next morning. It is as though the crushed ball-dress and the dishevelled
locks of the close of the evening reappeared, the same, before breakfast. Let us have homely
sense at the top of the page, pathos at the foot of it. What a force in the bad type of the
shabby little "Childe Harold" you used to read so often! You turn it over in a grand illustrated
edition, and it seems like another poem. Let it here be said, that occasionally you look with
something like indignation on the volume which enchained you in your boyish days. For now you
have burst the chain. And you have somewhat of the feeling of the prisoner towards the jailer
who held him in unjust bondage. What right had that bombastic rubbish to touch and thrill you
as it used to do? Well, remember that it suits successive generations at their enthusiastic
stage. There are poets whose great admirers are for the most part under twenty years old; but
probably almost every clever young person regards them at some period in his life as among
the noblest of mortals. And it is no ignoble ambition to win the ardent appreciation of even
immature tastes and hearts. Its brief endurance is compensated by its intensity. You sit by
the fireside and read your leisurely "Times," and you feel a tranquil enjoyment. You like it
better than the "Sorrows of Werter," but you do not like it a twentieth part as much as you
once liked the "Sorrows of Werter." You would be interested in meeting the man who wrote that
brilliant and slashing leader; but you would not regard him with speechless awe, as something
more than human. Yet, remembering all the weaknesses out of which men grow, and on which they
look back with a smile or sigh, who does not feel that there is a charm which will not depart
about early youth?

Such, readers as are young men will understand what has already been said as to the bitter
indignation with which the writer, some years ago, listened to self-conceited elderly persons
who put aside the arguments and the doings of younger men with the remark that these younger
men were boys. There are few terms of reproach which I have heard uttered with looks of such
deadly ferocity. And there are not many which excite feelings of greater wrath in the souls
of clever young men. I remember how in those days I determined to write an essay which should
scorch up and finally destroy all these carping and malicious critics. It was to be called
"A Chapter on Boys." After an introduction of a sarcastic and magnificent character, setting
out views substantially the same as those contained in the speech of Lord Chatham in reply
to Walpole, which boys are taught to recite at school, that essay was to go on to show that
a great part of English literature was written by very young men. Unfortunately, on proceeding
to investigate the matter carefully, it appeared that the best part of English literature,
even in the range of poetry, was in fact written by men of even more than middle age. So the
essay was never finished, though a good deal of it was sketched out. Yesterday I took out the
old manuscript; and after reading a bit of it, it appeared so remarkably Vealy, that I put
it with indignation into the fire. Still I observed various facts of interest as to great things
done by young men, and some by young men who never lived to be old. Beaumont the dramatist
died at twenty-nine. Christopher Marlowe wrote "Faustus" at twenty-five, and died at thirty.
Sir Philip Sidney wrote his "Arcadia" at twenty-six. Otway wrote "The Orphan" at twenty-eight,
and "Venice Preserved" at thirty. Thomson wrote the "Seasons" at twenty-seven. Bishop Berkeley
had devised his Ideal System at twenty-nine; and Clarke at the same age published his great
work on "The Being and Attributes of God." Then there is Pitt, of course. But these cases are
exceptional; and besides, men at twenty-eight and thirty are not in any way to be regarded
as boys. What I wanted was proof of the great things that had been done by young fellows about
two-and-twenty; and such proof was not to be found. A man is simply a boy grown up to his best;
and of course what is done by men must be better than what is done by boys. Unless in very
peculiar cases, a man at thirty will be every way superior to what he was at twenty; and at
forty to what he was at thirty. Not, indeed, physically,--let that be granted; not always morally;
but surely intellectually and aesthetically.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yes, my readers, we have all been Calves. A great part of all our doings has been, what the
writer, in figurative language, has described as Veal. We have not said, written, or done very
much on which we can now look back with entire approval; and we have said, written, and done
a very great deal on which we cannot look back but with burning shame and confusion. Very many
things, which, when we did them, we thought remarkably good, and much better than the doings
of ordinary men, we now discern, on calmly looking back, to have been extremely bad. That time,
you know, my friend, when you talked in a very fluent and animated manner after dinner at a
certain house, and thought you were making a great impression on the assembled guests, most
of them entire strangers, you are now fully aware that you were only making a fool of yourself.
And let this hint of one public manifestation of Vealiness suffice to suggest to each of us
scores of similar cases. But though we feel, in our secret souls, what Calves we have been,
and though it is well for us that we should feel it deeply, and thus learn humility and caution,
we do not like to be reminded of it by anybody else. Some people have a wonderful memory for
the Vealy sayings and doings of their friends. They may be very bad hands at remembering anything
else; but they never forget the silly speeches and actions on which one would like to shut
down the leaf. You may find people a great part of whose conversation consists of repeating
and exaggerating their neighbors' Veal; and though that Veal may be immature enough and silly
enough, it will go hard but your friend Mr. Snarling will represent it as a good deal worse
than the fact. You will find men, who while at college were students of large ambition, but
slender abilities, revenging themselves in this fashion upon the clever men who beat them.
It is easy, very easy, to remember foolish things that were said and done even by the senior
wrangler or the man who took a double first-class; and candid folk will think that such foolish
things were not fair samples of the men,--and will remember, too, that the men have grown out
of these, have grown mature and wise, and for many a year past would not have said or done
such things. But if you were to judge from the conversation of Mr. Limejuice, (who wrote many
prize essays, but, through the malice and stupidity of the judges, never got any prizes,) you
would conclude that every word uttered by his successful rivals was one that stamped them as
essential fools, and calves which would never grow into oxen. I do not think it is a pleasing
or magnanimous feature in any man's character, that he is ever eager to rake up these early
follies. I would not be ready to throw in the teeth of a pretty butterfly that it was an ugly
caterpillar once, unless I understood that the butterfly liked to remember the fact. I would
not suggest to this fair sheet of paper on which I am writing, that not long ago it was dusty
rags and afterwards dirty pulp. You cannot be an ox without previously having been a calf;
you acquire taste and sense gradually, and in acquiring them you pass through stages in which
you have very little of either. It is a poor burden for the memory, to collect and shovel into
it the silly sayings and doings in youth of people who have become great and eminent. I read
with much disgust a biography of Mr. Disraeli which recorded, no doubt accurately, all the
sore points in that statesman's history. I remember with great approval what Lord John Manners
said in Parliament in reply to Mr. Bright, who had quoted a well-known and very silly passage
from Lord John's early poetry. "I would rather," said Lord John, "have been the man who in
his youth wrote those silly verses than the man who in mature years would rake them up." And
with even greater indignation I regard the individual who, when a man is doing creditably and
Christianly the work of life, is ever ready to relate and aggravate the moral delinquencies
of his school-boy and student days, long since repented of and corrected. "Remember not," said
a man who knew human nature well, "the sins of my youth." But there are men whose nature has
a peculiar affinity for anything petty, mean, and bad. They fly upon it as a vulture on carrion.
Their memory is of that cast, that you have only to make inquiry of them concerning any of
their friends, to hear of something not at all to the friends' advantage. There are individuals,
after listening to whom you think it would be a refreshing novelty, almost startling from its
strangeness, to hear them say a word in favor of any human being whatsoever.

It is not a thing peculiar to immaturity; yet it may be remarked, that, though it is an unpleasant
thing to look back and see that you have said or done something very foolish, it is a still
more unpleasant thing to be well aware at the time that you are saying or doing something very
foolish. If a man be a fool at all, it is much to be desired that he should be a very great
fool; for then he will not know when he is making a fool of himself. But it is painful not
to have sense enough to know what you should do in order to be right, but to have sense enough
to know that you are doing wrong. To know that you are talking like an ass, yet to feel that
you cannot help it,--that you must say something, and can think of nothing better to say,--this
is a suffering that comes with advanced civilization. This is a phenomenon frequently to be
seen at public dinners in country towns, also at the entertainment which succeeds a wedding.
Men at other times rational seem to be stricken into idiocy when they rise to their feet on
such occasions; and the painful fact is, that it is conscious idiocy. The man's words are asinine,
and he knows they are asinine. His wits have entirely abandoned him: he is an idiot for the
time. Have you sat next a man unused to speaking at a public dinner? have you seen him nervously
rise and utter an incoherent, ungrammatical, and unintelligible sentence or two, and then sit
down with a ghastly smile? Have you heard him say to his friend on the other side, in bitterness,
"I have made a fool of myself"? And have you seen him sit moodily through the remainder of
the feast, evidently ruminating on what he said, seeing now what he ought to have said, and
trying to persuade himself that what he said was not so bad after all? Would you do a kindness
to that miserable man? You have just heard his friend on the other side cordially agreeing
with what he had said as to the badness of the appearance made by him. Enter into conversation
with him; talk of his speech; congratulate him upon it; tell him you were extremely struck
by the freshness and naturalness of what he said,--that there is something delightful in hearing
an unhackneyed speaker,--that to speak with entire fluency looks professional,--it is like
a barrister or a clergyman. Thus you may lighten the mortification of a disappointed man; and
what you say will receive considerable credence. It is wonderful how readily people believe
anything they would like to be true.

       *       *       *       *       *

I was walking this afternoon along a certain street, coming home from visiting certain sick
persons, and wondering how I should conclude this essay, when, standing on the pavement on
one side of the street, I saw a little boy four years old crying in great distress. Various
individuals, who appeared to be Priests and Levites, looked, as they passed, at the child's
distress, and passed on without doing anything to relieve it. I spoke to the little man, who
was in great fear at being spoken to, but told me he had come away from his home and lost himself,
and could not find his way back. I told him I would take him home, if he could tell me where
he lived; but he was frightened into utter helplessness, and could only tell that his name
was Tom, and that he lived at the top of a stair. It was a poor neighborhood, in which many
people live at the top of stairs, and the description was vague. I spoke to two humble decent-looking
women who were passing, thinking they might gain the little thing's confidence better than
I; but the poor little man's great wish was just to get away from us,--though, when he got
two yards off, he could but stand and cry. You may be sure he was not left in his trouble,
but that he was put safely into his father's hands. And as I was coming home, I thought that
here was an illustration of something I have been thinking of all this afternoon. I thought
I saw in the poor little child's desire to get away from those who wanted to help him, though
not knowing where to go when left to himself, something analogous to what the immature human
being is always disposed to. The whole teaching of our life is leading us away from our early
delusions and follies, from all those things about us which have been spoken of under the similitude
which need not be again repeated. Yet we push away the hand that would conduct us to soberer
and better things, though, when left alone, we can but stand and vaguely gaze about us; and
we speak hardly of the growing experience which makes us wiser, and which ought to make us
happier too. Let us not forget that the teaching which takes something of the gloss from life
is an instrument in the kindest Hand of all; and let us be humbly content, if that kindest
Hand shall lead us, even by rough means, to calm and enduring wisdom,--wisdom by no means inconsistent
with youthful freshness of feeling, and not necessarily fatal even to youthful gayety of mood,--and
at last to that Happy Place where worn men regain the little child's heart, and old and young
are blest together.

REMINISCENCES OF STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS.

I do not propose to enter upon a discussion of the question that now agitates the entire population
of Brandon township, Vermont,--namely, whether Douglas was born in the Pomeroy or the Hyatt
mansion. It is enough for our purpose to record the fact that he was born, and apparently well
born,--as, from the statement of Ann De Forrest, his nurse, he first appeared a stalwart babe
of fourteen pounds weight.

He lived a life of sensations; and that he commenced early is clearly shown by the fact that
he was a subject of newspaper comment when but two months old. At that age he had the misfortune
to lose his father, who, holding the baby boy in his arms, fell back in his chair and died,
while Stephen, dropping from his embrace, was caught from the fire, and thus from early death,
by a neighbor, John Conant, who opportunely entered the room at the moment. And here let me
say, that for generations back the ancestors of Douglas were sturdy men, of physical strength
and mental ability. His grandfather was noted for his strong practical common sense, which,
rightly applied, with industry, made him in middle life the possessor of wealth, and the finest
farm on Otter Creek. This, however, in later years was gradually taken from him, by means which
had better, perhaps, remain unmentioned. The father of Stephen was a physician of more than
ordinary talent and of much culture. He had attained but to early manhood, when a sudden attack
of heart-disease removed him from life, and compelled his widow, with her infant boy, to face
the world alone.

A bachelor brother of the Widow Douglas took her and the baby to his farm, where, for several
years, the one mourned the loss of her husband, while the other grew in strength and muscle.
The earlier developments of the boy were characteristic, and typical of those in later life.
He was very quick, magnetic in his temperament, and full to the brim with wit and humor. Beyond
his uncle's farm ran the far-famed Otter Creek, whose waters, in my boyhood, were forbidden
me, as inevitably leading the incautious bather to "a life of misery and a premature death."
There it was, however, that Stephen earned his earliest triumphs. It is a long pull across
the Otter Pond, and the schoolmaster's last charge was always, "Keep this side of the rock
in the middle,--don't try to cross"; but reckless then of life as since in politics, self-confident
and daring as always, Douglas, of all the boys, alone dared disobey the charge, and succeeded
in reaching safely the opposite shore.

His companions, sons of farmers well to do in the world, were preparing to enter college; and
Douglas, the best scholar in his class, the finest mathematician in the township, and who without
instruction had mastered the Latin Grammar and "Viri Romae," applied to his uncle for permission
to join them. The uncle, however, never noted for much liberality either of brain or pocket,
having taken to himself a wife and gotten to himself a boy, was unable to see the necessity
of giving the orphan a college education, and pitilessly bound him to a worthy deacon of the
church, as an apprentice to the highly respectable, but rarely famous, trade of cabinet-making.
In this Douglas did well. It has been stated elsewhere that "he was not fond of his trade,"
and that "his spirit pined for loftier employment." Possibly. But for all that he succeeded
in it, and these lines are being written on a mahogany table made by him while an apprentice
at Brandon. It is a strong, substantial, two-leaved table, with curiously carved legs terminating
in bear's-feet, the claws of which display an intimate acquaintance on the part of the maker
with the physiological formation of those appendages, and a more than ordinary amount of dexterity
in the handling of tools. It was while in this occupation that he gained the sobriquet of the
"Tough 'Un." He was nearly seventeen years of age, and, though not handsome, was very intelligent
and bright in his appearance, so that he was able to compete successfully for the smiles and
favors of a young country lass who reigned the belle of the village. This did not suit the
"mittened" ones, and they determined to draw young Douglas into a controversy which should
result in a fight,--he, of course, to be the defeated party. The night chosen for the onslaught
was the "singing-school night," and the time the homeward walk of Stephen from the house of
the fair object of contention. The crowd met him at the corner store. From jests to jibes,
from taunts to blows, was then, as ever, an easy path; and in reply to some unchivalric remark
concerning his lady-love, Douglas struck the slanderer with all his might. Immediately a ring
was formed, and kept, until Douglas rose the victor, and without further ceremony pitched into
one of the lookers-on, and stopped not until he, too, was soundly thrashed, when, with flashing
eye and clenched fist, he said,--"Now, boys, if that's not enough, come on, and I'll take you
all together!" At this juncture, the good old Deacon, who had been trying cider in the cellar
of the store, came along, and, taking Stephen by the arm, said,--"Well, Steve, you are a tough
'un! What! whipped two, and want more? Come home, my boy, come home!" He was allowed ever after
to go and come with his bright-eyed beauty, unmolested, and for years was known there and in
the neighboring townships as the "Tough 'Un." Here, too, he gained the reputation of being
a good fellow, a whole-souled friend, and a jolly companion. He would read, and his favorite
works were those telling of the triumphs of Napoleon, the conquests of Alexander, and the wars
of Caesar.

He was still desirous of a collegiate education, and it is undoubtedly true that constant application
to his books, when he should have been resting from the labors of the day, brought upon him
an illness, the severity of which compelled him to abandon his employment and return to his
uncle's house. There he obtained permission to take a course of classical studies at the academy,
a permission of which he availed himself with enthusiasm. He was then a fine, well-built youth,
foremost in plays, active in all country excursions, and ever popular with his elders. Indeed,
this last trait followed him through life; and when those of his own age were at sword's-point
with him, he was sure of finding friends and favor amongst such as were older and wiser than
himself. His mother, about this time, married a lawyer of wealth and position, residing in
the interior of New York, who, appreciating the talent of the boy, aided him in his laudable
endeavors to obtain an education, and sent him to the academy at Canandaigua in that State.
There Douglas was soon among the first. He was the most popular speaker of them all, pleasing
old and young, and causing the hall of the academy to be filled with an interested audience
whenever it was known that he was to be the orator of the night. His love of humor and his
keen sense of the ludicrous aided him not a little in the quick repartee, for which he was
then, as since, noted. He was far from idle during the three years of his life at Canandaigua;
for, besides applying himself with untiring energy and zeal to the pursuit of a classical course
at the academy, he devoted much of his time to reading in the law office of the Messrs. Hubbell.
His examiners for the bar stated that they had never before met a student who in so short a
time made such proficiency; and while they took pleasure in complimenting him, they also extended
to him the privileges which are accorded by rule only to those who have pursued a complete
collegiate course. This was especially gratifying and stimulating to Douglas, who remarked
to a fellow-student that for the wealth of a continent he would not have had his "mother die
without hearing that intelligence of her son's progress."

At the age of twenty, Douglas commenced, with the fairest prospects, the practice of law in
the beautiful village of Cleveland, Ohio. Hardly had the paint on his "shingle" become dry,
when a sudden attack of bilious fever prostrated him, and confined him to his room for months.
He was thoroughly restless; he pined for action; and when his physician said to him, "Sir,
if you allow yourself to fret in this manner, you will certainly frustrate my efforts, and
die," he replied, "Not now, Doctor; there's work ahead for me." Upon his recovery, he found
himself in a situation such as would crush the spirit of ninety-nine men in a hundred. He was
weak, with but a few dollars, with no friends, in a region of country that did not promise
him health, and with no knowledge of other localities. He paid his debts and left the place.
He wandered, literally, from town to town, until his means were gone and his strength well-nigh
exhausted, when, on a bright Wednesday morning in the month of November, 1833, he reached the
village of Winchester, Illinois.

In his head were his brains, in his pocket his cash resources, namely, thirty-seven and a half
cents, and in a checkered blue handkerchief his school-books and his wardrobe. He knew no one
there, he had no plan of action, and, foot-sore, with heavy heart, he leaned against a post
in the public square, and for the first time in his life gave way to gloomy forebodings. He
had, however, entered the town where his fortunes were to mend, his life to receive new vigor,
and his successful career to begin.

While standing thus, he noticed at the farther end of the square a crowd of people, and walked
towards them. On a platform stood a red-faced, burly auctioneer, with a straw hat and a loud
voice, who was arguing with some one in the crowd of expectant buyers the impossibility of
proceeding with the sale without a clerk to aid him. He was in the heat of the discussion,
when his eye fell upon the intelligent face and fragile form of young Douglas, to whom he beckoned,--when
the following dialogue ensued.

Auctioneer. I say, boy, you look like you're smart; can you figure?

Douglas. I can, Sir.

Auctioneer. Will a couple of dollars a day hire you, till we finish this sale?

Douglas. And board?

At which reply the crowd laughed, and the auctioneer, who thought he had found a treasure, said,--

"Yes, and board; tumble up and go to work."

Whereupon, Douglas, whose legs were weak, whose stomach was empty, and whose head fairly ached
with nervous excitement, mounted the platform, began his work as deputy-auctioneer, and laid
the foundations of a popularity in that section which increased with his years and strengthened
with his success. The sale for which he was hired continued three days, and attracted the residents
of the place and the farmers from the neighboring towns, all of whom were favorably impressed
by the bright look, the quick, earnest manner, the frequent humorous remarks, and the unvarying
courtesy of the young clerk. In the evenings, when gathered about the huge iron stove in the
bar-room of the hotel, and the doings, good or bad, of "Old Hickory" were the theme of discussion,
one and all sat quiet, listening with admiration, if not with conviction, to the conversation
of the youthful politician, who at that time was a great admirer of General Jackson.

With the same tact and adaptability to circumstances which were characteristic of him through
life, Douglas determined to make use of these people; and so dexterously did he manage, that,
before he had been with them a week, he had produced upon their minds the impression that he
was of all men the best suited to teach their district school the ensuing winter. He dined
with the minister, rode out with the doctor, and took tea with the old ladies. He talked politics
with the farmers, recounted adventures to the young men, and, if my informant is trustworthy,
was in no way shy of the young ladies. The zeal with which he sang on Sunday, and the marked
attention which he paid to the sermonizings of the dominic, advanced him so far in the affections
of the honest people of that rural town, that, had he asked their wealth, their prayers, or
their votes, he would have had no difficulty in obtaining them.

There are no reasons for believing, that, as a schoolmaster, he was particularly well qualified.
He did very well however, and satisfied the entire township, so that, had he been content with
that that very honorable, but somewhat inconspicuous life, he might doubtless have remained
there until this day. Up to this period he had been a strict temperance man. No intoxicating
drink had as yet passed his lips; and an early experiment with a pipe had so sickened him,
that he had resolved never again to attempt it. It would have been well for him, had he adhered
to that resolve; but, like many other politicians, he thought it necessary, in the days of
his early public life, to mix with the crowd, to join the bar-room circle, to tell his story
and sing his song, to smoke, and generally to conform to all those demands of pot-house oracles
which have perhaps elevated the few, but without doubt destroyed the many. His aim then was
popularity. He did his best as a teacher, giving his spare time to the law. Before the Justices'
Court he argued frequently, and commonly with success. There he gained reputation, and having
been elected member of the legislature, he determined to devote his life thenceforth to what
seemed to him kindred pursuits, politics and law.

In the latter his successes were frequent. At first he was employed, naturally, in minor cases;
but it was soon discovered that no one at the bar was his equal in the dexterous management
of a knotty point, the successful defence of a desperate villain, or the game of bluff with
judge, jury, or opposing counsel. His cases were such as developed his cunning, his ingenuity,
and tact, rather than tested his learning or research; and it is doubtful if he would, in the
practice of law alone, have achieved more than a local distinction, and that not in all respects
a desirable one. In the wording of the State Statutes he was well read, and he often availed
himself of his remarkable memory to the entire discomfiture of an opponent, whose technical
error, quickly detected by the watchful ear of Douglas, would be turned against him with great
effect. So constant was his success in the defence of criminal cases, that it was deemed well,
by the powers that were, to elevate him to the position of prosecuting attorney for the first
district of the State. This was done in 1835, when he was but twenty-two years of age. At that
time he was of singularly prepossessing appearance and popular manners. The people were fond
and proud of him; and when he made his acknowledgments to them for the above-mentioned token
of their confidence, he so excited them by his oratory, that they took him from the platform,
raised him upon their shoulders, and bore him in triumph about the town, while hundreds followed,
shouting, "Hurra for little Doug!" "Three cheers for the Little Giant!" "We'll put you through!"
and "You'll be President yet!"

The judges of the Supreme Court thought that a great mistake had been made; and one of them,
who in later years was one of Mr. Douglas's warmest friends, did not hesitate to say that the
election was wrong. "What business", asked he, "has this boy with such an office? He is no
lawyer, and has no books." Indeed, he met with no little opposition from his brethren at the
bar, but none that in any way impeded his progress in the affections of the people, or disheartened
him in his efforts after loftier place. Judge Morton relates, that at no time was Douglas found
unprepared. "His indictments were always properly drawn, his evidence complete, and his arguments
logical." Before a jury he was in his element. There he could indulge in story-telling, in
special pleading, and in all the intricate devices which beguile sober men of their senses,
and prove black white or good evil. From judge to jury, from the highest practitioner to the
lowest pettifogger, there soon came to be but one impression. He was acknowledged to be the
champion of the Illinois bar.

His career upon the bench, to which he was soon after elevated, was brilliant, because energetic,
and successful, because he never permitted contingencies to thwart a predetermination, and
because that coolness and grit which enabled him to whip a second sneering boy while he was
yet a youth had become a settled trait of his character. It was during the sitting of his court,
that the notorious Joe Smith was to be tried for some offence against the people of the State.
Mob-law had taken matters somewhat under its charge in the West; and the populace, fearing
that Smith, in this particular instance, might manage to slip from the hands of justice, determined
to take him from the court-house and hang him. They even went so far as to erect a gallows
in the yard, and, having entered the court-room, demanded from the sheriff the person of the
prisoner. Judge Douglas was in his seat; the room was filled with the infuriated mob and its
sympathizers; Smith sat pale and trembling in his box; while the sheriff, after vainly attempting
to quell the disturbance, fell powerless and half-fainting on the steps. "Sheriff," shouted
the judge, "clear the court!" It was easier said than done. Five hundred determined men are
not to be thwarted by a coward, and such the sheriff proved. It was a trying moment. The life
of Smith per se was not worth saving, but the dignity of the court must be upheld, and Douglas
saw at a glance that he had but a moment in which to do it. "Mr. Harris," said he, addressing
a huge and sinewy Kentuckian, "I appoint you sheriff of this court. Select your deputies. Clear
this court-house. Do it, and do it now." He had chosen the right man. Right and left fell the
foremost of the mob; some were pitched from the windows, others jumped thence of their own
accord; and soon the entire crowd, convinced of the judge's determination to maintain order,
rushed pell-mell from the court-room, while Smith, who had unperceived made his way up to the
feet of the judge, laid his head upon his knee and wept like a child. "Never," said Douglas,
"was I so determined to effect a result as then. Had Smith been taken from my protection, it
would have been only when I lay dead upon the floor." The fact that he had no right to appoint
a sheriff was not one of the "points of consideration." "How shall I execute my will?" was
probably the only question that suggested itself to his mind at the time, and the logic of
the answer in no way troubled him. The dignity of the bench was always upheld by Judge Douglas
during the sitting of the court; but he was no stickler for form or ceremony elsewhere.

A friend tells an amusing anecdote illustrative of his daring and somewhat foolhardy spirit,
even in mature life. Mr. Douglas, then a judge of the Supreme Court of Illinois, was one of
a number of passengers who, on the crack steamboat "Andrew Jackson," were going down the Mississippi.
The steamer was detained several hours at Natchez, where she was supplied with wood and water,
and during the delay a huge, hard-fisted boatman, somewhat the worse for a poor article of
strychnine whiskey, made himself very conspicuous and exceedingly obnoxious by the continual
iteration of his intense desire to fight some one. He was fearful that he would "ruin," if
his pugilistic wants were not immediately attended to, and in manner more earnest than agreeable
invited one and all to "come ashore and have the conceit taken out" of them. From the descriptive
catalogue he gave of his own merits, the passengers gathered that he was "a roarer," "a regular
bruiser," "half alligator, half steamboat, half snapping-turtle, with a leetle dash of chain-lightning
thrown in," and were evidently afraid of him; when the Judge, who had been quietly smoking
on the deck, stepped out upon the quay, and, approaching the bully, said, with a peculiarly
dry manner,--

"Who might you be, my big chicken, eh?"

"I'm a high-pressure steamer," roared the astonished boatman.

"And I'm a snag," replied Douglas, as he pitched into him; and before the fellow had time to
reflect, he lay sprawling in the mud.

A loud shout, mingled with derisive laughter, burst from the spectators, all of whom knew the
Judge; and while the discomfited braggart limped sorely off, the passengers carried Douglas
to the bar, where, for hours after, a general series of jollifications ensued, and he who a
few days before had sat the embodiment of judicial dignity on the supreme bench now vied with
a motley crowd of steamboat-passengers in song and story. As a judge he was as he should be;
but he was a judge only while literally on the bench.

The decisions of Judge Douglas were recognized always as able and impartial; but his habit
of "log-rolling," or, as the extreme Westerners call it, "honey-fugling" for votes and support,
had so grown upon him, that his sincere friends feared lest he would sink too low, and in the
end defeat himself. He had ascertained, however, that success was in the gift of the multitude,
and to them he ever remained faithful.

Had Mr. Douglas been born four months sooner than he was, he would have been a Senator of the
United States in 1842, when his age would have been thirty years; but owing to the fact that
he would not be thirty until April of the following year, his friends found it would be unadvisable
to elect him. In November, 1843, however, he was elected to the House, after passing through
one of the most exciting canvasses ever known in the West. Everywhere he met the people on
the stump. That seemed to be his appropriate forum, and the only position in which he could
indulge in his peculiarly popular style of oratory. His greatest achievement during that Congress
was his speech in defence of General Jackson,--a speech begun when the seats and halls were
comparatively empty, but concluded in the presence of an overwhelming audience. After the adjournment
of Congress, delegations from many of the States were sent to a monster Jackson Convention
held at Nashville, and Mr. Douglas was a member of the Illinois Committee. By invitation, he
stopped at the Hermitage. Hundreds of others were calling to pay their respects to the old
hero, and to congratulate him upon his triumph, when Douglas entered. He was short and plain,
and attracted little attention, till presented by Governor Clay of Alabama.

"I have delivered a speech in the House on that subject," replied Douglas.

"Then stop," said the General; "sit down here beside me; I desire to return you my thanks for
that speech."

And then, in the presence of that distinguished company, the aged soldier expressed his gratitude
for the words so kindly and justly spoken, and assured him of his great obligations. At the
conclusion of the interview, Douglas, who was unable to utter a word, grasped convulsively
the aged veteran's hand and left the hall.

At his death. General Jackson left all his papers to Mr. Blair, the editor of the Washington
"Globe," and among them was a printed copy of the speech, with this indorsement, written and
signed by himself:--"This speech constitutes my defence: I lay it aside as an inheritance for
my grandchildren."

In the famous Compromise struggle of 1850, Judge Douglas developed great strength of will and
wonderful executive ability. With Henry Clay he was on the most friendly terms, and that statesman
once said of him, that he knew of "no man so entirely an embodiment of American ideas and American
institutions as Mr. Douglas." It is well known that to Senator Douglas belongs the credit of
initiating the great "Compromise Bill," and that, though reported by Mr. Clay as from the Select
Committee of the Senate, it was in reality the California and Territorial Bills drawn up by
Mr. Douglas, united. It was at his own suggestion that this was done; and when Mr. Clay objected,
on the ground that it would be unfair for the Committee to claim the credit which belonged
exclusively to another, he rebuked him, and asked by what right he (Mr. Clay) jeoparded the
peace and harmony of the nation, in order that this or that man might receive the credit due
for the origin of a bill. It has been.

Some time after this, he had occasion, to visit Chicago, and his friends were desirous that
he should address the people in defence of the principle involved in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill.
On Saturday night he appeared before his audience in the open square in front of North Market
Hall. His opponents had been more active than his friends. Ten thousand roughs, determined
to make trouble, had assembled there; and when the speaker appeared, they saluted him with
groans, cat-calls, ironical cheers, and noises of all kinds. That sort of thing in no way annoyed
him. He was used to it. On similar occasions he had by wit and good-humor succeeded in gaining
a respectful and generally an enthusiastic hearing, and he expected to do so now. He was mistaken.
For four hours the contest raged between them. He entreated, he threatened, he laughed at them,
told stories, bellowed with the entire volume of his sonorous voice, but without success. They
defied and insulted him, until the clock in a neighboring church-tower tolled forth the midnight
hour. "Gentlemen," said Douglas, taking out his watch, and advancing to the front of the stand,
"it is Sunday morning. I have to bid you farewell. I am going to church, and you--can go to
----." Whereupon, he retired, and the crowd followed, hooting, jeering, and screaming, until
they left him at the door of his hotel.

No man living possessed warmer friends than Mr. Douglas. I saw tears of sorrow fall from the
eyes of hard-featured Western men, when at the Charleston Convention it became evident that
he could not receive the Presidential nomination. Hard words were spoken and hard blows were
given in his cause there, and subsequently at Baltimore; and it is doubtful if ever caucusing
or struggles for success insured more bitter or lasting hatreds than were engendered during
the prolonged contests at those places. The result of that strife, the subsequent canvassing
of the country in search of friends and votes, and the ultimate defeat, worked wonderful changes
in him, morally and physically. All that in years past he had looked for, all he had struggled
for, seemed put forever beyond his reach; and he was from that hour a different man. Fortunately
for him, gloriously for his reputation, the people of the South saw fit to rebel; and Douglas,
espousing the side of the right, has died a patriot. There had always been a feeling of friendship
existing between Mr. Lincoln and Judge Douglas; and the manner in which the latter acted just
prior to the Inauguration, and the gallant part he sustained at that time, as well as afterwards,
served to increase their mutual regard and esteem. It was my good-fortune to stand by Mr. Douglas
during the reading of the Inaugural of President Lincoln. Rumors had been current that there
would be trouble at that time, and much anxiety was felt by the authorities and the friends
of Mr. Lincoln as to the result. "I shall be there," said Douglas, "and if any man attacks
Lincoln, he attacks me, too." As Mr. Lincoln proceeded with his address, Judge Douglas repeatedly
remarked, "Good!" "That's fair!" "No backing out there!" "That's a good point!" etc.,--indicating
his approval of its tone, as subsequently he congratulated the reader and indorsed the document.

At the Inauguration Ball, all were waiting the arrival of the Presidential party. Much feeling
had been created in the city by the announcement that Washington people did not intend to patronize
the affair, and it was feared that it might fall through. Presently the band struck up "Hail
Columbia," and President Lincoln with his escort entered the room, followed by Mrs. Lincoln,
who was supported by Judge Douglas. A more significant demonstration of friendship and of personal
interest could not possibly be suggested; and Mr. Douglas, that night, by his genial manner,
his cordial sympathy with the personnel of the new Administration, and the effectual snubbing
which he thereby gave to the pretentious movers in Washington society, won for himself many
friends, and the gratitude of all the Republicans present.

About two months since, while in the telegraph office at Washington, I saw Mr. Douglas. Accosting
him, I asked what course he thought the President should pursue towards the sympathizers with
the South who remained in that city. "Well," replied he, "if I were President, I'd convert
or hang them all within forty-eight hours. However, don't be in a hurry. I've known Mr. Lincoln
a longer time than you have, or than the country has; he'll come out right, and we will all
stand by him."

The President was, in return, a warm friend of Mr. Douglas. I had occasion to inquire of him
if he had, as was reported in the newspapers, tendered to Judge Douglas the position of Brigadier-General.
"No, Sir," said Mr. Lincoln, "I have not done so; nor had I thought of doing so until to-night,
when I saw it suggested in the paper. I have no reason to believe Mr. Douglas would accept
it. He has not asked it, nor have his friends. But I must say, that, if it is well to appoint
brigadier-generals from the civil list, I can imagine few men better qualified for such a position
than Judge Douglas. For myself, I know I have not much military knowledge, and I think Douglas
has. It was he who first told me I should have trouble at Baltimore, and, pointing on the map,
showed me the route by Perryville, Havre de Grace, and Annapolis, as the one over which our
troops must come. He impressed on my mind the necessity of absolutely securing Fortress Monroe
and Old Point Comfort, and, in fact, I think he knows all about it." The President continued
at some length to refer to the aid, counsel, and encouragement he had received from Judge Douglas,
intimating that the relations subsisting between them were of the most amicable and pleasant
nature.

It was evidently the purpose of Mr. Douglas, during the present crisis, to impress upon the
country the fact, that at the outset he had declared himself a Union man, faithful to the Constitution
and the upholding of its powers.

Mr. Douglas has left many friends and many opponents, but few enemies. Careless of money, he
died poor. Generous to recklessness, he permitted his estate to become incumbered and taken
from him. Early in life he aimed at personal popularity, and obtained it. In later years he
desired legal honors, and they were his. Successful in all he undertook, he raised his ambition
to the highest post among his fellows, and its possession became the sole object of his life.
For its attainment he gave everything, yielded everything, did everything, and became everything,
without success. In all things he was extreme. His loves and hates were strong. His habits,
however they may be estimated, were apparent to all. His life--was it a failure?

His death I will but mention. It has plunged a loving family into sorrow, and taken from a
party its leader. Thousands of sentences gratifying to his friends are written about his greatness,
and the sacredness of his memory; and no word will be uttered here to offend them. He shall
himself close this paper, and I will be the medium of conveying in his behalf a message to
his fellow-countrymen,--a message which he spoke into the ear of his watchful wife, for the
future guidance of his orphan children:--

"Reviving slightly, he turned easily in his bed, and with his eyes partially closed, and his
hand resting in that of Mrs. Douglas, he said, in slow and measured cadence,--

"'TELL THEM TO OBEY THE LAWS AND SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.'"

AGNES OF SORRENTO.

CHAPTER IX.

THE ARTIST MONK.

On the evening when Agnes and her grandmother returned from the Convent, as they were standing
after supper looking over the garden parapet into the gorge, their attention was caught by
a man in an ecclesiastical habit, slowly climbing the rocky pathway towards them.

"Isn't that brother Antonio?" said Dame Elsie, leaning forward to observe more narrowly. "Yes,
to be sure it is!"

"Oh, how glad I am!" exclaimed Agnes, springing up with vivacity, and looking eagerly down
the path by which the stranger was approaching.

A few moments more of clambering, and the stranger met the two women at the gate with a gesture
of benediction.

He was apparently a little past the middle point of life, and entering on its shady afternoon.
He was tall and well proportioned, and his features had the spare delicacy of the Italian outline.
The round brow, fully developed in all the perceptive and aesthetic regions,--the keen eye,
shadowed by long, dark lashes,--the thin, flexible lips,--the sunken cheek, where, on the slightest
emotion, there fluttered a brilliant flush of color,--all were signs telling of the enthusiast
in whom the nervous and spiritual predominated over the animal.

At times, his eye had a dilating brightness, as if from the flickering of some inward fire
which was slowly consuming the mortal part, and its expression was brilliant even to the verge
of insanity.

His dress was the simple, coarse, white stuff-gown of the Dominican friars, over which he wore
a darker travelling-garment of coarse cloth, with a hood, from whose deep shadows his bright
mysterious eyes looked like jewels from a cavern. At his side dangled a great rosary and cross
of black wood, and under his arm he carried a portfolio secured with a leathern strap, which
seemed stuffed to bursting with papers.

Father Antonio, whom we have thus introduced to the reader, was an itinerant preaching monk
from the Convent of San Marco in Florence, on a pastoral and artistic tour through Italy.

Convents in the Middle Ages were the retreats of multitudes of natures who did not wish to
live in a state of perpetual warfare and offence, and all the elegant arts flourished under
their protecting shadows. Ornamental gardening, pharmacy, drawing, painting, carving in wood,
illumination, and calligraphy were not unfrequent occupations of the holy fathers, and the
convent has given to the illustrious roll of Italian Art some of its most brilliant names.
No institution in modern Europe had a more established reputation in all these respects than
the Convent of San Marco in Florence. In its best days, it was as near an approach to an ideal
community, associated to unite religion, beauty, and utility, as ever has existed on earth.
It was a retreat from the commonplace prose of life into an atmosphere at once devotional and
poetic; and prayers and sacred hymns consecrated the elegant labors of the chisel and the pencil,
no less than the more homely ones of the still and the crucible. San Marco, far from being
that kind of sluggish lagoon often imagined in conventual life, was rather a sheltered hotbed
of ideas,--fervid with intellectual and moral energy, and before the age in every radical movement.
At this period, Savonarola, the poet and prophet of the Italian religious world of his day,
was superior of this convent, pouring through all the members of the order the fire of his
own impassioned nature, and seeking to lead them back to the fervors of more primitive and
evangelical ages, and in the reaction of a worldly and corrupt Church was beginning to feel
the power of that current which at last drowned his eloquent voice in the cold waters of martyrdom.
Savonarola was an Italian Luther,--differing from the great Northern Reformer as the more ethereally
strung and nervous Italian differs from the bluff and burly German; and like Luther he became
in his time the centre of every living thing in society about him. He inspired the pencils
of artists, guided the counsels of statesmen, and, a poet himself, was an inspiration to poets.
Everywhere in Italy the monks of his order were travelling, restoring the shrines, preaching
against the voluptuous and unworthy pictures with which sensual artists had desecrated the
churches, and calling the people back by their exhortations to the purity of primitive Christianity.

Father Antonio was a younger brother of Elsie, and had early become a member of the San Marco,
enthusiastic not less in religion than in Art. His intercourse with his sister had few points
of sympathy, Elsie being as decided a utilitarian as any old Yankee female born in the granite
hills of New Hampshire, and pursuing with a hard and sharp energy her narrow plan of life for
Agnes. She regarded her brother as a very properly religious person, considering his calling,
but was a little bored with his exuberant devotion, and absolutely indifferent to his artistic
enthusiasm. Agnes, on the contrary, had from a child attached herself to her uncle with all
the energy of a sympathetic nature, and his yearly visits had been looked forward to on her
part with intense expectation. To him she could say a thousand things which she instinctively
concealed from her grandmother; and Elsie was well pleased with the confidence, because it
relieved her a little from the vigilant guardianship that she otherwise held over the girl.
When Father Antonio was near, she had leisure now and then for a little private gossip of her
own, without the constant care of supervising Agnes.

"Dear uncle, how glad I am to see you once more!" was the eager salutation with which the young
girl received the monk, as he gained the little garden. "And you have brought your pictures;--oh,
I know you have so many pretty things to show me!"

"Well, well, child," said Elsie, "don't begin upon that now. A little talk of bread and cheese
will be more in point. Come in, brother, and wash your feet, and let me beat the dust out of
your cloak, and give you something to stay Nature; for you must be fasting."

"Thank you, sister," said the monk; "and as for you, pretty one, never mind what she says.
Uncle Antonio will show his little Agnes everything by-and-by.--A good little thing it is, sister."

"Yes, yes,--good enough,--and too good," said Elsie, bustling about;--"roses can't help having
thorns, I suppose."

"Only our ever-blessed Rose of Sharon, the dear mystical Rose of Paradise, can boast of having
no thorns," said the monk, bowing and crossing himself devoutly.

Agnes clasped her hands on her bosom and bowed also, while Elsie stopped with her knife in
the middle of a loaf of black bread, and crossed herself with somewhat of impatience,--like
a worldly-minded person of our day, who is interrupted in the midst of an observation by a grace.

After the rites of hospitality had been duly observed, the old dame seated herself contentedly
in her door with her distaff, resigned Agnes to the safe guardianship of her uncle, and had
a feeling of security in seeing them sitting together on the parapet of the garden, with the
portfolio spread out between them,--the warm twilight glow of the evening sky lighting up their
figures as they bent in ardent interest over its contents. The portfolio showed a fluttering
collection of sketches,--fruits, flowers, animals, insects, faces, figures, shrines, buildings,
trees,--all, in short, that might strike the mind of a man to whose eye nothing on the face
of the earth is without beauty and significance.

"Oh, how beautiful!" said the girl, taking up one sketch, in which a bunch of rosy cyclamen
was painted riding out of a bed of moss.

"Ah, that indeed, my dear!" said the artist, "Would you had seen the place where I painted
it! I stopped there to recite my prayers one morning; 't was by the side of a beautiful cascade,
and all the ground was covered with these lovely cyclamens, and the air was musky with their
fragrance.--Ah, the bright rose-colored leaves! I can get no color like them, unless some angel
would bring me some from those sunset clouds yonder."

"And oh, dear uncle, what lovely primroses!" pursued Agnes, taking up another paper.

"Yes, child; but you should have seen them when I was coming down the south side of the Apennines;--these
were everywhere so pale and sweet, they seemed like the humility of our Most Blessed Mother
in her lowly mortal state. I am minded to make a border of primroses to the leaf in the Breviary
where is the 'Hail, Mary!'--for it seems as if that flower doth ever say, 'Behold the handmaid
of the Lord!'"

"And what will you do with the cyclamen, uncle? does not that mean something?"

"Yes, daughter," replied the monk, readily entering into that symbolical strain which permeated
all the heart and mind of the religious of his day,--"I can see a meaning in it. For you see
that the cyclamen puts forth its leaves in early spring deeply engraven with mystical characters,
and loves cool shadows, and moist, dark places, but comes at length to wear a royal crown of
crimson; and it seems to me like the saints who dwell in convents and other prayerful places,
and have the word of God graven in their hearts in youth, till these blossom into fervent love,
and they are crowned with royal graces."

"Ah!" sighed Agnes, "how beautiful and how blessed to be among such!"

"Thou sayest well, dear child. Blessed are the flowers of God that grow in cool solitudes,
and have never been profaned by the hot sun and dust of this world!"

"I should like to be such a one," said Agnes. "I often think, when I visit the sisters at the
Convent, that I long to be one of them."

"A pretty story!" said Dame Elsie, who had heard the last words,--"go into a convent and leave
your poor grandmother all alone, when she has toiled night and day for so many years to get
a dowry for you and find you a worthy husband!"

"I don't want any husband in this world, grandmamma," said Agnes.

"What talk is this? Not want a good husband to take care of you when your poor old grandmother
is gone? Who will provide for you?"

"He who took care of the blessed Saint Agnes, grandmamma."

"Saint Agnes, to be sure! That was a great many years ago, and times have altered since then;--in
these days girls must have husbands. Isn't it so, brother Antonio?"

"But if the darling hath a vocation?" said the artist, mildly.

"Vocation! I'll see to that! She sha'n't have a vocation! Suppose I'm going to delve, and toil,
and spin, and wear myself to the bone, and have her slip through my fingers at last with a
vocation? No, indeed!"

"Indeed, dear grandmother, don't be angry!" said Agnes. "I will do just as you say,--only I
don't want a husband."

"Well, well, my little heart,--one thing at a time; you sha'n't have him till you say yes willingly,"
said Elsie, in a mollified tone.

Agnes turned again to the portfolio and busied herself with it, her eyes dilating as she ran
over the sketches.

"Ah! what pretty, pretty bird is this?" she asked.

"Knowest thou not that bird, with his little red beak?" said the artist. "When our dear Lord
hung bleeding, and no man pitied him, this bird, filled with tender love, tried to draw out
the nails with his poor little beak,--so much better were the birds than we hard-hearted sinners!--hence
he hath honor in many pictures. See here,--I shall put him into the office of the Sacred Heart,
in a little nest curiously built in a running vine of passion-flower. See here, daughter,--I
have a great commission to execute a Breviary for our house, and our holy Father was pleased
to say that the spirit of the blessed Angelico had in some little humble measure descended
on me, and now I am busy day and night; for not a twig rustles, not a bird flies, nor a flower
blossoms, but I begin to see therein some hint of holy adornment to my blessed work."

"Oh, Uncle Antonio, how happy you must be!" said Agnes,--her large eyes filling with tears.

"Happy!--child, am I not?" said the monk, looking up and crossing himself. "Holy Mother, am
I not? Do I not walk the earth in a dream of bliss, and see the footsteps of my Most Blessed
Lord and his dear Mother on every rock and hill? I see the flowers rise up in clouds to adore
them. What am I, unworthy sinner, that such grace is granted me? Often I fall on my face before
the humblest flower where my dear Lord hath written his name, and confess I am unworthy the
honor of copying his sweet handiwork."

The artist spoke these words with his hands clasped and his fervid eyes upraised, like a man
in an ecstasy; nor can our more prosaic English give an idea of the fluent naturalness and
grace with which such images melt into that lovely tongue which seems made to be the natural
language of poetry and enthusiasm.

Agnes looked up to him with humble awe, as to some celestial being; but there was a sympathetic
glow in her face, and she put her hands on her bosom, as her manner often was when much moved,
and, drawing a deep sigh, said,--

"Would that such gifts were mine!"

"They are thine, sweet one," said the monk. "In Christ's dear kingdom is no mine or thine,
but all that each hath is the property of the others. I never rejoice so much in my art as
when I think of the communion of saints, and that all that our Blessed Lord will work through
me is the property of the humblest soul in his kingdom. When I see one flower rarer than another,
or a bird singing on a twig, I take note of the same, and say, 'This lovely work of God shall
be for some shrine, or the border of a missal, or the foreground of an altar-piece, and thus
shall his saints be comforted.'"

"But," said Agnes, fervently, "how little can a poor young maiden do! Ah, I do so long to offer
myself up in some way to the dear Lord, who gave himself for us, and for his Most Blessed Church!"

As Agnes spoke these words, her cheek, usually so clear and pale, became suffused with a tremulous
color, and her dark eyes had a deep, divine expression;--a moment after, the color slowly faded,
her head drooped, and her long, dark lashes fell on her cheek, while her hands were folded
on her bosom. The eye of the monk was watching her with an enkindled glance.

"Is she not the very presentment of our Blessed Lady in the Annunciation?" said he to himself.
"Surely, this grace is upon her for this special purpose. My prayers are answered.

"Daughter," he began, in a gentle tone, "a glorious work has been done of late in Florence
under the preaching of our blessed Superior. Could you believe it, daughter, in these times
of backsliding and rebuke there have been found painters base enough to paint the pictures
of vile, abandoned women in the character of our Blessed Lady; yea, and princes have been found
wicked enough to buy them and put them up in churches, so that the people have had the Mother
of all Purity presented to them in the guise of a vile harlot. Is it not dreadful?"

"How horrible!" said Agnes.

"Ah, but you should have seen the great procession through Florence, when all the little children
were inspired by the heavenly preaching of our dear Master. These dear little ones, carrying
the blessed cross and singing the hymns our Master had written for them, went from house to
house and church to church, demanding that everything that was vile and base should be delivered
up to the flames,--and the people, beholding, thought that the angels had indeed come down,
and brought forth all their loose pictures and vile books, such as Boccaccio's romances and
other defilements, and the children made a splendid bonfire of them in the Grand Piazza, and
so thousands of vile things were consumed and scattered. And then our blessed Master exhorted
the artists to give pencils to Christ and his Mother, and seek for her image among pious and
holy women living a veiled and secluded life, like that our Lady lived before the blessed Annunciation.
'Think you,' he said, 'that the blessed Angelico obtained the grace to set forth our Lady in
such heavenly wise by gazing about the streets on mincing women tricked out in all the world's
bravery?--or did he not find her image in holy solitudes, among modest and prayerful saints?'"

"Ah," said Agnes, drawing in her breath with an expression of awe, "what mortal would dare
to sit for the image of our Lady!"
