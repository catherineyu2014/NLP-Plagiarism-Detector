PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOLUME 147.

November 25, 1914.

CHARIVARIA.

ENVER PASHA, in a proclamation to the Turkish troops, says: "The army will destroy all our
enemies with the aid of Allah and the assistance of the Prophet." It is rumoured that the KAISER
is a little bit piqued about it.

       ***

We learn from a German paper that, since the brave Ottomans have discovered that their Culture
and that of the Germans are one, many Englishmen who live in Crescents are crying out in fury
for an alteration of their addresses.

       ***

According to a Berlin journal, about 2,000 players of orchestral instruments have been thrown
out of employment by the war. It is suggested that, with a view to providing them with more
employment, reverses as well as victories should be musically celebrated in the capital.

       ***

We are glad to see that the names of battles in Belgium show a tendency to become more cheery.
The other day, for instance, we had the battle of the Yperlee--and we may yet have a battle
of Yip-i-yaddy-i-yay.

       ***

It is rumoured that a compromise has been arrived at in regard to the proposal, emanating from
America, that the war shall be stopped for twenty-four hours on Christmas Day. The combatants,
it is said, have agreed to fire plum-puddings instead of cannon-balls.

       ***

Among the promotions which we do not remember seeing gazetted is that of KARL GUSTAV ERNST,
a German barber-spy. At the Old Bailey, the other day, Mr. Justice COLERIDGE promoted him to
be a Steinhauer or stone-hacker.

       ***

    "'MIRACLE' PRODUCER KILLED."--Daily Chronicle.

This is unfortunate for the Germans, for if ever they needed a miracle it is now.

       ***

"Information that has come into our possession," says The Grocer, "proves to our satisfaction
that Germany has been receiving plentiful supplies of tea from our shores through neutral countries
since the outbreak of hostilities." The italics are ours: the satisfaction appears to be our
contemporary's.

       ***

A cynic sends us a tip for the recruiting department of our army. "Why go for the single man?"
he asks. "We may expect just as much courage from the married man. He has already proved his
pluck."

       ***

    "HOW DE WET ESCAPED. A MISSING LINK IN THE CORDON."--Observer.

The Germans, who have already been calling the Allied forces "The Menagerie," should appreciate
this item.

       ***

Angry newspaper men are now calling a certain institution the Suppress Bureau.

       ***

A solicitor having announced that he is prepared to make the wills of the men of a certain
regiment free of charge, another enterprising legal gentleman, not to be outdone, would like
it to be known that he is willing to act as residuary legatee without a fee.

       ***

In his interesting sketch, in The Times, of the PRINCE OF WALES' career at the University,
the PRESIDENT of Magdalen mentions that His Royal Highness "shot at various country houses
round Oxford." We hope that this will not be quoted against the PRINCE by a spiteful German
Press, should any bullet marks be found one day on the walls of some castle on the Rhine.

       ***

It came as quite an unpleasant surprise to many persons to learn from Mr. ASQUITH that the
War is costing us a million pounds a day, that being more than some of us spend in a year.

The End of the Press Bureau.

    "Members of several guilds carried their banners in the
    procession which went round the church to the accompaniment of
    impressive music and the swinging of censors."--South Western
    Star.

If this had got about, there would have been a bigger crowd at the ceremony. As it was, Fleet
Street was taken by surprise, and only had time to prepare a few fireworks for the evening.
