[114] The last two figures look like 15 but the first two are scarcely legible; it may not
be a date at all.

[115] All the statues are rather Northern in appearance, not unlike those on the royal tombs
in Santa Cruz, Coimbra, and may be the work of the two Flemings mentioned among those employed
at Thomar, Antonio and Gabriel.

[116] The door--notwithstanding the supposed date, 1515--was probably finished by João after 1523.

[117] Cf. the carving on the jambs of the Allah-ud-din gate at Delhi.

[118] Such heads of many curves may have been derived from such elaborate Moorish arches as
may be seen in the Alhambra, or, for example, in the Hasan tower at Rabat in Morocco, and it
is worth noticing that there were men with Moorish names among the workmen at Thomar--Omar,
Mafamede, Bugimaa, and Bebedim.

[119] Esp(h)era=sphere; Espera=hope, present imperative.

[120] The inscription says: 'Aqui jaz Matheus Fernandes mestre que foi destas obras, e sua
mulher Izabel Guilherme e levou-o nosso Senhor a dez dias de Abril de 1515. Ella levou-a a....'

[123] The frieze is now filled up and plastered, but not long ago was empty and recessed as
if prepared for letting in reliefs. Can these have been of terra cotta of the della Robbia
school? Dom Manoel imported many which are now all gone but one in the Museum at Lisbon. There
are also some della Robbia medallions at the Quinta de Bacalhôa at Azeitão near Setubal.

[125] One of the first was probably the chapel dos Reys Magos at São Marcos near Coimbra.

[126] A conto = 1.000$000.

[127] It is no use telling a tramway conductor to stop near the Torre de São Vicente. He has
never heard of it, but if one says 'Fabrica de Gas' the car will stop at the right place.

[128] Similar roofs cap the larger angle turrets in the house of the Quinta de Bacalhôa near
Setubal, built by Dona Brites, mother of Dom Manoel, about 1490, and rebuilt or altered by
the younger Albuquerque after 1528 when he bought the Quinta.

[129] Raczynski says 1517, Haupt 1522.

[130] According to Raczynski, João de Castilho in 1517 undertook to carry on the work for 140$000
per month, at the rate of $50 per day per man. 140$000=now about £31.

[131] Nicolas was the first of the French renaissance artists to come to Portugal.

[132] E.g. on the Hotel Bourgthéroulde, Rouen.

[133] Cf. the top of a turret at St. Wulfram, Abbeville.

[134] Haupt.

[135] The university was first accommodated in Sta. Cruz, till Dom João gave up the palace
where it still is. It was after the return of the university to Coimbra that George Buchanan
was for a time professor. He got into difficulties with the Inquisition and had to leave.

[136] Nicolas the Frenchman is first mentioned in 1517 as working at Belem. He therefore was
probably the first to introduce the renaissance into Portugal, for Sansovino had no lasting
influence.

[137] 'To give room and licence to Dioguo de Castylho, master of the work of my palace at Coimbra,
to ride on a mule and a nag seeing that he has no horse, and notwithstanding my decrees to
the contrary.'--Sept. 18, 1526.

[139] Other men from Rouen are also mentioned, Jeronymo and Simão.

[140] The stone used at Batalha and at Alcobaça is of similar fineness, but seems better able
to stand exposure, as the front of Santa Cruz at Coimbra is much more decayed than are any
parts of the buildings at either Batalha or Alcobaça. The stone resembles Caen stone, but is
even finer.

[141] João de Ruão also made some bookcases for the monastery library.

[142] 'Aqui jas o muito honrado Pero Rodrigues Porto Carreiro, ayo que foy do Conde D. Henrique,
Cavalleiro da Ordem de San Tiago, e o muyto honrado Gonzalo Gil Barbosa seu genro, Cavalleiro
da Ordem de X^to, e assim o muito honrado seu filho Francisco Barbosa: os quaes forão trasladados
a esta sepultura no anno de 1532.'--Fr. Historia de Santarem edificada. By Ignacio da Piedade
e Vasconcellos. Lisboa Occidental, MDCCXXXX.

[143] The date 1522 is found on a tablet on Ayres' tomb, so the three must have been worked
while the chancel was being built.

[146] There is also a fine reredos of somewhat later date in the church of Varziella near Cantanhede
not far off: but it belongs rather to the school of the chapel dos Reis Magos; there is another
in the Matriz of Cantanhede itself.

[148] The only other object of any interest in the São Marcos is a small early renaissance
pulpit on the north side of the nave, not unlike that at Caminha.

[149] During the French invasion much church plate was hidden on the top of capitals and so
escaped discovery.

[150] João then bought a house in the Rua de Corredoura for 80$000 or nearly £18.--Vieira Guimarães,
A Ordem de Christo, p. 167.

[151] There is preserved in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon a long account of the trial of a 'new
Christian' of Thomar, Jorge Manuel, begun on July 15, 1543, in the office of the Holy Inquisition
within the convent of Thomar.--Vieira Guimarães, p. 179.

[152] From book 34 of João III.'s Chancery a 'quitaçã' or discharge given to João de Castilho
for all the work done for Dom João or for his father, viz.--'In Monastery of Belem; in palace
by the sea--swallowed up by the earthquake in 1755--balconies in hall, stair, chapel, and rooms
of Queen Catherine, chapel of monastery of São Francisco in Lisbon, foundation of Arsenal Chapel;
a balcony at Santos, and divers other lesser works. Then a door, window, well balustrade, garden
repairs; work in pest house; stone buildings at the arsenal for a dry dock for the Indian ships;
the work he has executed at Thomar, as well as the work he has done at Alcobaça and Batalha;
besides he made a bastion at Mazagão so strong,' etc.--Raczynski's Les Artistes Portugais.

[155] Ferguson (History of Modern Architecture, vol. ii. p. 287) says that some of the cloisters
at Gôa reminded him of Lupiana, so no doubt they are not unlike those here mentioned.

[156] An inscription over a door outside says:

DNS. EMANVEL NORONHA EPVS LAMACEN. 1557.

[157] One chapel, that of São Martin, has an iron screen like a poor Spanish reja.

[158] It has been pulled down quite lately. Lorvão, in a beautiful valley some fifteen miles
from Coimbra, was a very famous nunnery. The church was rebuilt in the eighteenth century,
has a dome, a nuns' choir to the west full of stalls, but in style, except the ruined cloister,
which was older, all is very rococo.

[159] This reredos is in the chapel on the south of the Capella Mor.

[160] This aqueduct begun by Terzi in 1593 was finished in 1613 by Pedro Fernandes de Torres,
who also designed the fountain in the centre of the cloister.
