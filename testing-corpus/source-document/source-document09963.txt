Scotch Members on before Ireland was approached. Something about the Scotch Private Bill Procedure
Bill. Formidable List of Amendments to LORD-ADVOCATE's proposal to nominate Committee. All
the Clans muster. NOVAR moves Amendment; CAMPBELL-BANNER-MAN objected that thirteen Scotch
Members, including LENG and LYON PLAYFAIR, "would not make an adequate Committee." ROBERT-SON
brought against the LORD-ADVOCATE the grave charge that he was "interpolating an extraneous
and alien body into this business." Lord KINGSBURY, ex-Lord-Advocate, happened to be under
Gallery on chance visit to House. Heard this remark with huge delight. Reminded him of the
times when he used to sit through long nights with back fairly set against the Gangway post
of Treasury Bench, invoking blessings on head of Duke of ARGYLL, and driving the Liberal Scotch
Members wild with his perpetual smile of content.

Business done.--Committee on Irish Land Bill started.

Friday Night.--When House met at Morning Sitting OLD MORALITY discovered on Treasury Bench,
looking more than usually guileless. Been badgered all week about Labour Committee. When going
to disclose names of Commissioners and set forth terms of reference? Only yesterday Brer RABBIT
put the question, intimating that whenever the announcement was made Adjournment of House would
be moved in order to protest against omission of DAVITT's name. OLD MORALITY answering, said
it was possible he might be able to make the announcement to-day, but much more likely on Monday.

Everyone thought it would be Monday. Brer RABBIT in his place to-day, but his men absent. OLD
MORALITY, with positively a halo of innocency round his head, suddenly appeared at table; read
out the list of Commissioners. Brer RABBIT's hand forced; must needs forthwith ask leave to
move the Adjournment.

"Got your forty men?" asked the SPEAKER.

"Not quite," said Brer RABBIT, apologetically.

Only twenty-nine; so Brer RABBIT bowled out, and opportunity lost.

"Dear me!" said OLD MORALITY; "how very unfortunate. Now if I'd only waited till Monday, House
would have been quite full; Brer RABBIT would have got his forty men twice over; we should
have had an embarrassing Debate, and lost several hours of the sitting. As things have turned
out, we can now go straight on with business."

Business done.--In Committee on Irish Land Bill.

THE RETURN OF THE WANDERER.--JOHNNIE has come marching home. JOHN LAWRENCE TOOLE, of the wide
world generally, of London peculiarly, and of King William Street particularly, has returned.
Divine WILLIAMS, always on the spot for any remarkable event, foresaw the happy day when, in
Henry the Eighth, Act v., So. 3, he wrote, "The great TOOLE come!" May we venture to surmise
that it will not be long ere we see the announcement of our favourite comedian's appearance
in an entirely new and original farce entitled Ici on Parle Français?

WHAT'S IN A NAME? (From a Correspondent).--Sir, I send you a cutting from a communication of
J. MORTIMER GRANVILLE's, to The Lancet, No. 3,527, p. 798. Which when found make a note of:--"Instead
of thallin I use a Periodohydromethyloxychinolin, because that is better borne, and seems to
be more effective than the Tetrahydroparaquinasol." These two words would be a good penn'orth
in a telegram. Yours, EPIGRAMMATIST.
