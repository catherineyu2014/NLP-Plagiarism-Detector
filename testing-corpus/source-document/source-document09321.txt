Some Press Opinions.

    "Turn where you will in his pages you get some interesting glimpse
    which opens up the past and illumines the present."--Contemporary
    Review.

    "A handsome and very interesting book is the result for which the
    curious reader and the student will alike be grateful. Gives an
    admirable impression of the times."--Spectator.

    "It has not been possible to more than hint at the extraordinary
    interest and value of his work, part only of a greater. In spirit
    and arrangement it resembles those two fascinating volumes that the
    De Goncourts published: 'La Société Française sous la Revolution et
    sous le Directoire,' but is, of course, far more varied in its
    contents."--Pilot.

    "Stimulating, edifying, interesting, horrifying in turns, the book
    has not a dull moment. As it is the best, it will surely prove the
    most prized and popular of modern books on London."--Notes and
    Queries.
