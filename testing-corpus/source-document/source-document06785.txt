  Evening red and morning grey
  Will send the traveller on his way;
  But--blasting-powder on kites' tails spread,
  Will bring down rain upon his head.

RETORT BY A WASHED-OUT WAYFARER.

  If dynamite would bring fine weather,
  Scientists might be in fine feather,
  As 'tis, I sing, to the schoolboy tune,
  "Yah-bah! (oxyhydrogen) balloon!"

FATHER AND SON.

(A POSSIBLE DIALOGUE AFTER A RECENT DECISION AT MARYLEBONE.)

Father. And now, my dear Son, I must ask you for your rent.

Son. But surely, Father, I am entitled to a room in your house?

Father. Out of my love and affection; but this is a matter of business; and, if you desire
to be a Voter, you must behave as such.

Son. But I have had some difficulty in scraping up enough to pay you.

Father. Surely, eighteen shillings a-week is a reasonable sum for an apartment, however small,
in Mayfair?

Son. I do not deny it; still it seems hard that I should be mulcted to that extent some fifty
times a-year.

Father. I cannot see the hardship, nor the money!

Son. If you really want it, it is here.

    [Produces a pocket-book, from which he takes sufficient
    change to satisfy the claim.

Father (pocketing coin). Thank you; and now we may say, adieu!

Son. But how about dinner--am I not to dine with you?

Father. Dine with me! What an idea! Why should you?

Son. Because I am your Son.

Father. You mean someone infinitely more important--my Lodger.

Son. And you absolutely refuse me food?

Father. Not I, my boy; not I! It is the law! If I was to give you what you ask, you and I would
be had up for bribery.

Son. Then you prefer patriotism to paternal affection?

Father. Well, to be candid with you, I do! It is distinctly cheaper!

MUSCOVITE VERSION OF A MUSIC-HALL CHORUS.

    HIRSCH! HIRSCH! HIRSCH!
      Here comes the Bogie Man!
  He wants to help the Hebrews; he'll catch them if he can.
    HIRSCH! HIRSCH! HIRSCH!
      He's hit upon a plan,
  And all the persecutors cry, "Here comes the Bogie Man!"

  DOWNEY has photographed "the FIFES" at home.
  Aha! Domestic music! FIFE and "drum "!

OUR REAL DESIDERATUM.

(BY A "WELL-INFORMED" FOOL.)

  Ah! I was fogged by the Materialistic,
    By HUXLEY and by ZOLA, KOCH and MOORE;
  And now there comes a Maëlstrom of the Mystic,
    To whirl me further yet from sense's shore.
  Microbes were much too much for me, bacilli
    Bewildered me, and phagocytes did daze,
  But now the author 'cute of "Piccadilly,"
    HARRIS the Prophet, the BLAVATSKY craze,
  Thibet, Theosophy, and Bounding Brothers--
    No, Mystic Ones--Mahatmas I should say,
  But really they seem so much like the others
    In slippery agility!--day by day
  Mystify me yet more. Those germs were bad enough,
    But what are they compared with Astral Bodies?
  Of Useless Knowledge I have almost had enough,
    I really envy uninquiring noddies,
  I would not be a Chela if I could.
    I have a horror of the Esoterical.
  BESANT and OLCOTT may be wise and good,
    They seem to me pursuing the chimerical.
  Maddened by mysteries of "Precipitation,"
    The Occult Dream and the Bacillus-Dance;
  We need Societies for the propagation
    Of Useful--Ignorance!

DWARFS IN AND ABOUT LONDON.

Sir,--We need not go so far afield as Messrs. HALIBURTON & CO. in search of dwarfs. In the
suburbs of London, and even in the more densely-populated districts of this vast Metropolis,
there are numbers of people who are uncommonly short. About quarter-day these extraordinary
individuals may be heard of, but are rarely seen; which fact, however, affords no proof of
their non-existence.
