  Paul was a blasphemer and a persecutor and
injurious at his conversion, but he had to be a lifetime in grace and an apostle above all
the twelve before he became the chiefest of sinners and the most wretched of saints.  And though
your first forgiveness was, no doubt, a great proof of the grace of God, yet it was nothing,
nothing at all, to your forgiveness to-day.  You had no words for the wonder and the praise
of your forgiveness to-day.  You just took to your lips the cup of salvation and let that silent
action speak aloud your monumental praise.  You were a sinner at your regeneration, else you
would not have been regenerated. But you were not then the chief of sinners.  But now.  Ah,
now!  Those words, the chief of sinners, were but idle words in Paul's mouth.  He did not know
what he was saying.  For, what has horrified and offended other men when it has been spoken
with bated breath to them about envy, and hate, and malice, and revenge, and suchlike remainders
of hell, all that has been a breath of life and hope to you.  It has been to you as when Christian,
in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, heard a voice in the darkness which proved to him that
there was another sinner at the mouth of hell besides himself.  There is no text that comes
oftener to your mind than this, that whoso hateth his brother is a murderer; and, communicant
as you are, you feel and you know and you are sure that there are many men lying in lime waiting
the day of judgment to whom it would be more tolerable than for you were it not that you are
to be at that day the highest monument in heaven or earth to the redeeming, pardoning, and
saving grace of God.  Yes, this is the name that shall be written on you; this is the name
that shall be read on you of all who shall see you in heaven; this name that Emmanuel pronounced
over Mansoul that day from His ascending chariot-steps, a very Spectacle of wonder, and a very
Monument of the mercy and the grace of God.
