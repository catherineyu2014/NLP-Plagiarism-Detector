THE NUPTIALS OF BARCELONA.--A Tale of Priestly Frailty and Spanish Tyranny. By R. N. DUNBAR.

    "This work is powerfully written. Beauty, pathos, and great powers of
    description are exhibited in every page. In short, it is well
    calculated to give the author a place among the most eminent writers of
    the day."--Sunday Times.

SAUNDERS & OTLEY, Publishers, Conduit Street. With numerous Woodcuts.

    "It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe that this work is of an
    archæological, not of a theological character; the Editor has not
    considered it his business to examine into the truth or falsehood of
    the legends of which he narrates the substance; he gives them merely as
    legends, and in general so much of them only as is necessary to explain
    why particular emblems were used with a particular saint, or why
    Churches in a given locality are named after this or that
    saint."--Preface.

THE SEVEN PERIODS OF ENGLISH CHURCH ARCHITECTURE. Defined and Illustrated by EDMUND SHARPE,
M.A., Architect, M.I.B.A. An Elementary Work showing at a single glance the different Changes
through which our National Architecture passed, from the Heptarchy to the Reformation. Twelve
Steel Engravings and Woodcuts.

Each Period, except the First, is illustrated by portions of the Interior and the Exterior
of one of our Cathedral Churches of corresponding date, beautifully engraved on Steel, so presented
as to enable the Student to draw for himself a close comparison of the characteristic features
which distinguish the Architecture of each of the SEVEN PERIODS, and which are of so striking
and simple a nature as to prevent the possibility of mistake.

The First, or Saxon Period, contains so few buildings of interest or importance, as to render
its comparative illustration unnecessary, if not impossible.

A TABLE OF ANTI-LOGARITHMS. Containing to Seven Places of Decimals, natural Numbers, answering
to all Logarithms from 0001 to 99999; and an improved Table of Gauss's Logarithms, by which
may be found the Logarithm to the sum or difference of Two Quantities where Logarithms are
given: preceded by an Introduction, containing also the History of Logarithms, their Construction,
and the various Improvements made therein since their invention. By HERSCHELL E. FILIPOWSKI.
Second edition, revised and corrected.

The publisher, having purchased the copyright and stereotype plates of these tables, (published
a few months ago at 2l. 2s.,) is enabled to offer a corrected edition at the above reduced price.

Testimonial of Augustus de Morgan, Esq.

    "I have examined the proofs of Mr. Filipowski's Table of
    Anti-Logarithms and of Gauss's Logarithms, and also the plan of his
    proposed table of Annuities for three lives, constructed from the
    Carlisle Table.

    "The table of Anti-Logarithms is, I think, all that could be wished, in
    extent, in structure, and in typography. For its extent it is unique
    among modern Tables. Of accuracy I cannot speak, of course; but this
    being supposed, I have no hesitation in recommending it without
    qualification.

    "The form in which Gauss's Tables are arranged will be a matter of
    opinion. I can only say that Mr. Filipowski's Table is used with ease,
    as I have found upon trial; and that its extent, as compared with other
    tables, and particularly with other FIVE-FIGURE tables, of the same
    kind, will recommend it. I desire to confine myself to testifying to
    the facility with which this table can be used: comparison with other
    forms, as to RELATIVE facility, being out of the question on so short a
    trial.

    "On the table of Annuities for three lives, there is hardly occasion to
    say anything. All who are conversant with Life Contingencies are well
    aware how much it is wanted. A. DE MORGAN."
