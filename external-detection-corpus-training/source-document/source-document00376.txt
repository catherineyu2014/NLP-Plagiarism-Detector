  104 Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, p. 357. Mr. Round’s statements (op.
      cit., Appendix P), that "this one firma ... represents one
      corpus comitatus, namely Middlesex, inclusive of London," and that
      "from this conclusion there is no escape," are more capable of
      refutation than he is willing to allow.

  M71 The citizens’ right to elect their own Justiciar.

  105 "It is probable that whilst the Sheriff in his character of Sheriff
      was competent to direct the customary business of the Court, it was
      in that of justitia that he transacted business under the King’s
      writ."—Stubbs, Const. History, i, 389, note.

  106 "Post hoc prædictus Justitiarius ... accessit ad Gildhalle
      Londoniarum, et ibi tenuit placita de die in diem ... et
      incontinenti ... ilia terminavit nullo juris ordine observato contra
      leges civitatis et etiam contra leges et consuetudines cujuslibet
      liberi hominis de regno Anglie. Quod vero cives semper
      calumpniaverunt, dicentes quod nullus debet placitare in civitate de
      transgressionibus ibidem factis nisi vicecomites Londoniarium."—Lib.

  M72 London and the election of Stephen, 1135

  108 Mat. Paris (Hist. Angl. i, 251), ascribes the incessant turmoil of
      the latter part of the reign to the vengeance of the deity for this
      breach of faith.

  109 "Id quoque sui esse juris, suique specialiter privilegii, ut si rex
      ipsorum quoquo moclo obiret, alius suo provisu in regno
      substituendus e vestigio succederet."—Gesta Stephani (Rolls Series
      No. 82), iii, 5-6.

  110 "With the solemn independent election of a king, the great part
      which London was to play in England’s history had definitely
      begun."—Green, London and her Election of Stephen.

  112 Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, p. 18.

  M75 Arrival of the Empress Matilda in England. 1139.
  M76 Attempted negotiations between Stephen and Matilda, May, 1140.

  113 "Eodem anno in Pentecoste resedit rex Londoniæ in Turri, episcopo
      tantum modo Sagiensi præsente: ceteri vel fastidierunt vel timuerunt
      venire. Aliquanto post, mediante legato, colloquium indictum est
      inter imperatricem et regem. si forte Deo inspirante pax reformari
      posset."—Malmesbury, Hist. Nov. (Rolls Series No. 90.), ii, 564.

  M77 Matilda formally acknowledged "Lady of England," 1141.

  114 "Juravit et affidavit imperatrix episcopo quod omnia majora negotia
      in Anglia præcipueque donationes episcopatuum et abbatiarum ejus
      nutum spectarent, si eam ipse cum sancta ecclesia in dominam
      reciperet et perpetuam ei fidelitatem teneret.... Nec dubitavit
      episcopus imperatricem in dominam Angliæ recipere, et ei cum
      quibusdam suis affidare, quod, quamdiu ipsa pactem non infringeret
      ipse quoque fidem ei custodiret."—Id., ii, 573.

  M78 A synod at Winchester, 7th April, 1141.

  115 "Ventilata est hesterno die causa secreto coram majori parte cleri
      Angliæ ad cujus jus potissimum spectat principem eligere, simulque
      ordinare."—Id., ii, 576.

  M79 The Londoners summoned to attend the synod.
  M80 They arrive and request the king’s release, 9th April, 1141.

  116 "Missos se a communione quam vocant Londoniarum."—Malmesbury, (Hist.
      Nov.), ii, 576. Exception may be taken to translating communio as
      ’commune’; but even if the municipal organization represented by the
      French term commune did not at this period exist in the City of
      London in all its fulness, the "communal idea" appears to have been
      there.—Stubbs, Const. Hist., i. 407.

  117 "Omnes barones qui in eorum coramunionem jamdudum recepti
      fuerant."—Malmesbury, Ibid.

  M81 Their request backed up by a letter from the Queen.
  M82 The Londoners after much hesitation receive the Empress into their
      city, June, 1141.

  118 "Proficiscitur inde cum exultatione magna et gaudio, et in
      monasterio Sancti Albani cum processionali suscipitur honore et
      jubilo. Adeunt eam ibi cives multi ex Lundonia, tractatur ibi sermo
      multimodus de reddenda civitate."—Contin. Flor. Wigorn. (Thorpe),
      ii, 131.

  119 "Erecta est autem in superbiam intolerabilem, quia suis incerta
      belli prosperavissent."—Hen. of Huntingdon (Rolls Series No. 74), p.
      275.

  120 "Infinitæ copiæ pecuniam, non simplici cum mansuetudine sed cum ore
      imperioso ab eis exegit."—Gesta Stephani (Rolls Series No. 82), iii,
      75.

  121 "Interpellata est a civibus, ut leges eis regis Edwardi observari
      liceret, quia optimæ erant, non patris sui Henrici quia graves
      erant. Verum illa non bono usa consilio, præ nimia austeritate non
      acquievit eis, unde et motus magnus factus in urbe; et facta
      conjuratione adversus eam quam cum honore susceperunt. cum dedecore
      apprehendere statuerunt."—Contin. Flor. Wigorn. (Thorpe), ii, 132.

  M83 The Empress forced to leave the city.

  122 Malmesbury (Hist. Nov.), ii, 577-578.  "Sed tandem a Londoniensibus
      expulsa est in die Sancti Johannis Baptiste proximo sequenti"—Lib.
      de Ant. (Camd. Soc), p. 197.

  123 "Anno prædicto [i.e. 7 Stephen, A.D. 1141], statim in illa estate,
      obsessa est Turris Lundoniarum a Londoniensibus, quam Willielmus
      [sic] de Magnaville tenebat et firmaverat."—Lib. de Ant. (Camd.
      Soc.), p. 197. From this it would appear that the father still held
      the office of constable. A charter of the empress, however, which
      Mr. Horace Round prints in his book on Geoffrey de Mandeville (pp.
      88, seq.) points to the son as being constable at the time.

  M84 Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, and Constable of the Tower,
      won over by the Empress.

  124 Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, pp. 88-95.

  M85 Forsakes the Empress for the Queen.

  125 It is not to be supposed that the earl consented to assist the queen
      without meeting with some return for his services, more especially
      as the queen was prepared to go all lengths to obtain her husband’s
      liberty. See Round’s Geoffrey de Mandeville, p. 119.

  M86 Capture of Winchester, and release of Stephen, Sept., 1141.

  126 "Gaufrido de Mandevilla, qui jam iterum auxilio eorum cesserat,
      antea enim post captionem regis imperatrici fidelitatem juraverat,
      et Londoniensibus maxime annitentibus, nihilque omnino quod possent
      prætermittentibus quo imperatricem contristarent."—Malmesbury (Hist.
      Nov.), ii, 580.

  127 "Magnæ ex Lundoniis copiæ."—Newburgh, Hist. Rerum. Angl. (Rolls
      Series No. 82.), i, 42. "Cumque invictâ Londoniensium
      catervâ."—Gesta Stephani (Rolls Series No. 82), iii, 80. The
      Londoners sacked Winchester mercilessly. "Londonienses, cum maxima
      militum regalium parte, modis horrendis Wintoniensem civitatem
      expilavere."—Gesta Stephani, iii, 84.

  M87 His second charter to Mandeville.

  128 The precedent thus set by Stephen, of submitting to the ceremony of
      a second coronation after a period of captivity, was afterwards
      followed by Richard I, on his return from captivity abroad.

  129 This is the date assigned to the charter by Mr. Horace Round,
      (Geoffrey de Mandeville, pp. 138-144). Cf. Appendix to 31st Report
      of Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, p. 3.

  M88 London holds the balance between the rival powers.

  130 The date assigned by Mr. Round to this charter is between Christmas,
      1141, and the end of June, 1142.

  131 "Et convenciono eidem Gaufredo Comiti Essex quod dominus meus Comes
      Andegavie vel ego vel filii nostri nullam pacem aut concordiam cum
      Burgensibus Lund[oniæ] faciemus, nisi concessu et assensu præ-dicti
      Comitis Gaufredi quia inimici eius sunt mortales."—Round’s Geoffrey

      that land, with the appurtenances, which was formerly of Gilbert
      Becket, father of the Blessed Thomas the Martyr, Archbishop of
      Canterbury, where the said Blessed Thomas the Martyr was born
      (duxit originem), to build a church (basilicam) in honour of
      Almighty God and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of the same most

      proveniant ex ipsa poterit diffinitione perpendi, quæ talis
      est—communia tumor plebis, timor regni, tepor sacerdotii."—Chron.
      Stephen, Hen. II, Ric. I (Rolls Series No. 82), iii, 416.

 M108 Change of name from port-reeve to mayor.

  157 "It is impossible to avoid a suspicion," writes Bishop Stubbs, "that
      the disappearance of the port-reeve and other changes in the
      municipal government, signify a civic revolution, the history of
      which is lost."—Const. Hist., i, 406n.

 M109 When did the change take place?

  158 Merewether and Stephens, Hist. of Boroughs (1835), i, 384. No
      authority, however, is given for this statement.

  159 The entire MS. was published in Latin by the Camden Society in 1846;
      and a translation of the original portion of the work was afterwards
      made by the late Mr. H. T. Riley, under the title "Chronicles of the
      Mayors and Sheriffs of London, A.D. 1188 to A.D. 1274."

  160 "The correct date of the accession of Richard has never been
      ascertained. No records appear to be extant to fix the commencement
      of the reign of any king before the accession of John."—Nicholas,
      Chronology of Hist., p. 285.

  162 Or simply Thedmar.

  163 It is thus that Riley reads the word which to me appears to be
      capable of being read "Grennigge."

  164 Calendar of Wills. Court of Husting, London, part. I., p. 22. From
      another Will, that of Margery, relict of Walter de Wynton, and one
      of Fitz-Thedmar’s sisters—she is described as daughter of "Thedmar,
      the Teutonic"—it appears that other sisters of Fitz-Thedmar married
      into the well-known city families of Eswy and Gisors.—Id., part i,

      exactions of the wealthier traders.—Students’ History of England, i,

  187 The sword of St. Paul, emblematic possibly of his martyrdom, still

      the dagger with which Sir William Walworth is said to have killed
      Wat Tyler.

 M124 Feud between Fitz-Walter and King John.

  188 The story is told in Mr. Riley’s Introduction to the Liber
      Custamarum (p. lxxix), on the authority of the Chronicle of Dunmow.

  189 He is said to have made a similar attempt upon the wife of Eustace
      de Vesci, a leading baron.—(Blackstone, Introd. to Magna Carta, pp.
      289, 290).

 M125 The Barons admitted into the City, May, 1215.

  190 Mat. Paris, ii, 156. A different complexion, however, is put on this
      event by another chronicler. According to Walter de Coventry (Rolls
      Series, No. 58, ii, 220) the barons made their way into the City by
      stealth, scaling the walls at a time when most of the inhabitants
      were engaged in divine service, and having once gained a footing
      opened all the City gates one after another.

  207 Often spoken of as the Treaty of Lambeth (Rymer’s Fœdera, i, 148.)

 M136 Departure of Louis after borrowing a sum of money from the citizens.

  208 The sum mentioned by Matthew Paris (ii. 224) is £5,000 sterling, but
      according to a marginal note in the Liber de Ant. (fol. 39) it would
      appear to have been only £1,000, which, according to the compiler of
      that record, Louis repaid the Londoners as soon as he arrived home,
      out of pure generosity (mera liberalitate sua). On the other hand,
      Matthew Paris (ii, 292) under the year 1227, narrates that Henry
      extorted from the citizens of London 5,000 marks of silver, on the

  255 Chron. of Mayors and Sheriffs, p. 77. This anecdote is inserted in
      the margin of Fitz-Thedmar’s chronicle, the writer expressing his
      horror at the "wondrous and unheard of" conduct of "this most

      an after-thought. Mr. Loftie (Hist, of London, i, 151), suggests
      that possibly the news of Fitz-Thomas’ death might have been the
      occasion of its insertion.

      City—Hust. Roll. 274, (10), (12).

 M164 The fate of Fitz-Thomas unknown.

  263 In narrating this, Fitz-Thedmar again discloses his aristocratic
      proclivities by remarking, "Such base exclamations did the fools of
      the vulgar classes give utterance to" on this occasion, viz., the
      election of William Fitz-Richard as Sheriff of Middlesex and Warden
      of London.—Chron. of Mayors and Sheriffs, pp. 90, 91.

 M177 Hervy’s so-called "charter" to the guilds.

  283 What Fitz-Thedmar means when he says (Chron. of Mayors and Sheriffs,
      p. 171), that "only one part of the seal of the Commonalty of
      London" was appended to Hervy’s so-called "charter" is hard to
      determine. The common seal of the city was at this period in the
      custody of the mayor for the time being. Under Edward II, it was for
      the first time entrusted to two aldermen and two commoners for safe
      keeping.—City Records, Letter Book D, fo. 145b.  Cf. Ordinances of

      communitatis civitatis illius."—Lib. Custumarum (Rolls Series), pt.
      1, pp. 269-270.

  287 "The establishment of the corporate character of the city under a
      mayor marks the victory of the communal principle over the more
      ancient shire organisation, which seems to have displaced early in
      the century the complicated system of guild and franchise. It also
      marks the triumph of the mercantile over the aristocratic
      element."—Stubbs, Const. Hist., i, 630, 631.

  301 For one month after the Feast of St. Botolph the Abbot [17 June],
      the Court of Husting in London was closed, owing to the absence of
      citizens attending the fair. The right of appointing their own
      officers to settle disputes arising at the fair was granted to the
      citizens of London at the close of the Barons’ War.—Chron. of Mayors
      and Sheriffs, p. 176.

 M191 Strong Government of the city under Edward I.

  303 A series of MS. books extending from A.D. 1275 to 1688, deriving
      their title from the letters of the alphabet with which they are
      distinguished, A, B, C, &c, AA, BB, CC, &c. We are further aided by
      chronicles of the reigns of Edward I and II, edited by Bishop Stubbs
      for the Master of the Rolls. A portion of these chronicles the
      editor has fitly called "Annales Londonienses." There is even reason
      for believing them to have been written by Andrew Horn, citizen and
      fishmonger, as well as eminent jurist of his day. He died soon after
      the accession of Edward III. and by his will, dated 9th Oct., 1328,
      (Cal. of Wills, Court of Husting, i, 344) bequeathed to the city
      many valuable legal and other treatises, only one of which (known to
      this day as "Liber Horn,") is preserved among the archives of the

      Andrew Horn, no longer preserved at the Guildhall. The story also
      appears in Chron. Edward I and II (Rolls Series No. 76), i, 94.

 M199 For thirteen years the city governed by a custos instead of a
      mayor.

  314 In 1293 the king appointed Elias Russell and Henry le Bole his
      "improvers" (appropriatores) in the city:—Chron. Edward I and II,
      (Rolls Series No. 76, i, 102). Their duties were practically
      identical with those of sheriffs, and Bishop Stubbs places a
      marginal note over against the appointment,—"Sheriffs appointed by
      the king." Walter Hervy is recorded as having removed certain stones
      near Bucklersbury when he was "improver" of the city (Letter Book A,
      fo. 84. Riley’s Memorials, p. 25). This was probably done in 1268,
      when the city was in the king’s hand, and Hervy and William de
      Durham were appointed bailiffs "without election by the
      citizens."—Chron. Mayors and Sheriffs, pp. 112, 113.

      hands of the Lombard bankers; hence arose, no doubt, the difficulty
      which he had in managing the City of London; hence came also the
      financial mischief which followed the banishment of the Jews; and
      hence an accumulation of popular discontent, which showed itself in
      the king’s lifetime by opposition to his mercantile policy, and,
      after his death, supplied one of the most efficient means for the
      overthrow of his son."—Chron. Edward I and II. Introd. vol. i, pp.

 M293 Implements of war stored at the Guildhall.

  516 Letter Book F, fly-leaf. The passage was printed by the late Mr.
      Riley, although somewhat inaccurately, in his Memorials (p. 205).
      The original MS. runs thus: "Item in Camera Gildaule sunt sex
      Instrumenta de Laton vocata Gonnes cum quinque teleres ad eadem.
      Item pelete de plumbo pro eidem Instrumentis que ponderant iiijc li
      et dj. Item xxxij li de pulvere pro dictis instrumentis."

  517 The late Mr. Riley misread "roleres" for "teleres" (the writing is
      not very legible), and therefore thought the passage referred to
      heavy ordnance.

  554 It was the first of the three pestilences (the others occurring in

      for dating conveyances and other records.—See Bond’s Handy-book for
      verifying dates, p. 311.

  555 Stow extravagantly conjectures that no less than 50,000 perished
      within a year, all of whom were buried in Walter Manny’s cemetery,
      near the Charterhouse. Another chronicler states that 200 were
      buried there alone between February and April, 1349.—Avesbury (Rolls
      Series No. 93), p. 407.

  556 Whilst the king forbade the encouragement of beggars by gifts of
      charity, the municipal authorities fixed the price of labour.—Letter
      Book F. fos. 163, 168, 169, 181. At the close of the year (1349) a
      statute—known as the Statute of Labourers—was passed, fixing the
      scale of wages at the rate prevalent before the Black Death, and
      ordering punishment to be inflicted on those who demanded more.

      qui nec inferioribus adquiescere, nec superiorum allegationibus sive
      monitis flecti valeret quin quod inceperat proprio ingenio torvo
      proposito ad quemcunque finem perducere niteretur."—Walsingham, ii,
      65.

  645 Letter Book H, fo. 144. (Memorials, p. 463).

  646 Letter Book H, fo. 146b.

  647 -Id., fos. 153-154.

 M350 Northampton re-elected mayor at the king’s request, Oct., 1382.

  648 Walsingham, ii, 71. From the City’s Records it appears that early in
      1383, William Baret was alderman of Philipot’s ward (Cornhill); but
      in the following year, when Brembre succeeded to his mayoralty, and
      the so-called "king’s party" was again in the ascendant, Philipot
      again appears as alderman of his old ward, continuing in office
      until his death (12 Sept., 1384), when he was succeeded by John
      Rote.—Letter Book H, fos. 163, 174.

  649 Letter Book H, fo. 155b.

  650 Letter Book H, fo. 154.

 M351 Brembre succeeds Northampton in the mayoralty, Oct., 1383.

  651 Letter Book H, fo. 168. Three years later, "the folk of the Mercerye
      of London" complained to parliament that Brembre and his "upberers"
      had on this occasion obtained his election by force—"through debate
      and strenger partye."—(Rot., Parl. iii, 225). There is no evidence
      of this in the City’s Records, although there appears to have been a
      disturbance at his re-election in 1384. It may be to this that the
      Mercers’ petition refers. It is noteworthy that at the time of his
      election in 1383, Brembre was not an alderman, although in the
      previous year, and again in the year following his election, he is
      recorded as Alderman of Bread Street Ward.—Letter Book H, fos. 140,
      163, 174.

      suam ut consueverunt. Dated 27 Nov., 1383.—Letter Book H, fo. 172.

      and John Harwell, Sergeants-at-Arms.—Letter Book H, fo. 215b.

 M360 Northampton set free, 27 April, 1387.

  677 "Super quo dominus Rex respondit quod licet in sua potestate fuerat
      cum ipsis, Johanne, Johanne et Ricardo agere graciose bene tamen
      sibi provideret priusquam foret eis graciam concessurus."—Letter

  678 Higden, Polychron. ix, 93.

  679 Letter Book H, fo. 222.

 M361 Letter from the mayor to the king, 5 Oct.

  680 The oath as set out in the letter to the king differs from another
      copy of the oath, which immediately precedes the letter in Letter
      Book H, fos. 220b, 221; a clause having been subsequently added to
      the latter to the effect that the swearer abjured the opinions of
      Northampton and his followers, and would oppose their return within
      the bounds and limits set out in the king’s letters patent.

  708 -Id., fo. 270.

 M381 The mayor summoned to Nottingham, June, 1392.

  709 Higden, ix, 270. According to Walsingham (Hist. Angl. ii, 208), the
      Lombard failed to get the money from the citizens, who nearly killed
      him when they learnt his purpose.

  710 The names of the citizens chosen for the occasion are given by
      Higden (Polychron. ix, 269, 270), and in Letter Book H, fo. 270.

  711 The reason given in the City Records for the dismissals which
      followed is stated to be "certain defects in a commission under the
      common seal and other causes."—Letter Book H, fo. 270b.

      suggests that this was done at the instance of the Archbishop of
      York, the Chancellor.

  717 "Putabant isti officiarii per hoc non modicum damnificare civitatem
      Lundoniæ, sed potius hoc multo majora damna intulerunt regi et

      Notwithstanding these remissions, the city was mulcted, according to
      Waisingham (ii, 211), in no less a sum than £10,000 before it
      received its liberties.—Cf. Chron. of London, 1089-1483 (ed. by
      Sir H. Nicolas, sometimes called "Tyrrell’s Chronicle," from a City
      Remembrancer of that name), p. 80.

      Volumes among the City’s archives known as "Journals" to assist us.
      They contain minutes of proceedings of the Court of Common Council,
      just as the "Repertories" (which we shall have occasion to consult
      later on), contain a record of the proceedings of the Court of
      Aldermen. The Letter Books may now be regarded as "fair copies" of
      the more important of the proceedings of both Courts.

 M391 Proceedings against the Lollards.

  734 Letter Book H, fo. 307b. The Lollards are said to have derived their
      name from a low German word lollen, to sing or chant, from their
      habit of chanting, but their clerical opponents affected to derive
      it from the Latin lolium, as if this sect were as tares among the
      true wheat of the church.

 M393 Henry’s other troubles.

  749 License, dated Westminster, 29 May, 12 Henry IV (A.D. 1411).—Letter

      rector of St. Peter’s for the time being should in future take
      precedence of the rectors of all other city churches, on the ground
      that Saint Peter’s was the first church founded in the city of
      London, having been built in 199 by King Lucius, and for 400 years
      or more held the metropolitan chair.—Letter Book I, fo. 203.

  751 A certain William Fyssher, a parchemyner or parchment-maker of

      escape, and was executed at Tyburn.—Letter Book I, fo. 181b.

 M399 The last Statute against the Lollards, 1414.

  754 2 Hen. V. Stat. i, c. 7.

  755 It was not, however, the last occasion upon which parliamentary
      action was attempted. In 1422, and again in 1425, the Lollards were
      formidable in London, and parliament on both occasions ordered that
      those who were in prison should be delivered at once to the
      Ordinary, in accordance with the provisions of this Statute.—Stubbs,
      Const. Hist., iii, 81, 363.

      Mayor’s precedence in the City was submitted to Charles II in 1670,
      when that monarch insisted upon Sir Richard Ford, the Lord Mayor of
      the day, giving "the hand and the place" to the Prince of Orange

      being entertained by the City.—Repertory, 76, fos. 28b, 29.

      much controversy, some contending that it is in effect a grant of
      the soil of the river from Staines to Yantlet, that being the extent
      of the City’s liberties on the Thames, whilst others restrict the
      grant to the City’s territorial limits, i.e., from Temple Bar to

  867 William Cantelowe, alderman of Cripplegate and Billingsgate wards,
      from the latter of which he was discharged in October, 1461, on the
      score of old age and infirmity (Journal 6, fo. 81b). He appears in
      his time to have had financial dealings with the crown, on one
      occasion conveying money over sea for bringing Queen Margaret to
      England, and on another supplying gunpowder to the castle of
      Cherbourg, when it was in the hands of the English. He is thought by
      some to be identical with the William Cantelowe who afterwards (in
      1464) captured Henry VI in a wood in the North of England.—"Three

      sickly as he was, in the hope of exciting the sympathy of the

 1179 This convent—the most virtuous house of religion in England—was of
      the Order of St. Bridget, and received an annual visit from the
      mayor and aldermen of the City of London at what was known as "the
      pardon time of Sion," in the month of August. In return for the
      hospitality bestowed by the lady abbess on these occasions the Court
      of Aldermen occasionally made her presents of wine (Repertories 3,
      fo. 94b; 7, fo. 275). In 1517 the court instructed the chamberlain
      to avoid excess of diet on the customary visit. There was to be no
      breakfast on the barge and no swans at dinner (Repertory 3, fo.
      154b). In 1825 the Court of Common Council decreed (inter alia)
      that "as tonchyng the goyng of my lord mayre and my masters his
      brethern the aldermen [to] Syon, yt is sett at large and to be in

      1556. Buried in the church of St. Peter, Cornhill.—Machyn. 115, 352.
      It was in Huberthorne’s mayoralty that the customary banquet to the
      aldermen, the "officers lerned" and the commoners of the city, on
      Monday next after the Feast of Epiphany, known as "Plow Monday," was
      discontinued.—Letter Book Q, fo. 191b. It was afterwards renewed and
      continues to this day in the form of a dinner given by the new mayor
      to the officers of his household and clerks engaged in various
      departments of the service of the Corporation. An attempt was at the
      same time made to put down the lord mayor’s banquet
      also.—Wriothesley, i, 176.

 M661 Accession and coronation of Edward VI, 1547.

 1266 "The lord mayor of London, Henry Hobulthorne, was called fourth, who
      kneeling before the king, his majestie tooke the sworde of the Lord
      Protector and made him knight, which was the first that eaver he
      made."—Wriothesley’s Chron. (Camd. Soc, N.S., No. 11.), i, 181.

 1267 This mace is still in possession of the Corporation. It is only
      brought out for use on such occasions as a coronation, when it is
      carried by the lord mayor as on the occasion narrated above, and at
      the annual election of the chief magistrate of the city, when it is
      formally handed by the Chamberlain to the lord mayor elect. The mace
      consists of a tapering shaft of rock crystal mounted in gold, with a
      coroneted head also of gold, adorned with pearls and large jewels.
      Its age is uncertain. Whilst some hazard the conjecture that it may
      be of Saxon origin, there are others who are of opinion that the
      head of it at least cannot be earlier than the 15th century.
