BY W. B. GREGORY, M. AM. SOC. C. E.

During the last few years a quantity of literature has appeared in which the treatment of timber
by preservatives has been discussed. The properties of timber, both treated and untreated,
have been determined by the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, and through
its researches valuable knowledge has come to engineers who have to deal with the design of
wooden structures. There is very little information, however, regarding the effect of time
on creosoted timber, and for this reason the results given herewith may prove of interest.

The material tested consisted of southern pine stringers having a cross-section approximately
6 by 16 in. and a length of 30 ft. For the purpose of testing, each beam was cut into two parts,
each about 15 ft. long. This material had been in use in a trestle of a railroad near New Orleans
for 26 years. The stringers were chosen at random to determine the general condition of the
trestle. The timber had been exposed to the weather and subjected to heavy train service from
the time it was treated until it was tested. The annual rainfall at New Orleans is about 60
in., and the humidity of the air is high. In spite of these conditions, there was no appearance
of decay on any of the specimens tested. The specifications under which the timber was treated
were as follows:

TIMBER.

The timber for creosoting shall be long-leafed or southern pine. Sap surfaces on two or more
sides are preferred.

Piles.--The piles shall be of long-leafed or southern pine, not less than 14 in. at the butt.
They shall be free from defects impairing their strength, and shall be reasonably straight.

The piles shall be cleanly peeled, no inner skin being left on them. The oil used shall be
so-called creosote oil, from London, England, and shall be of a heavy quality.

The treatment will vary according to the dimensions of the timbers and length of time they
have been cut. Timbers of large and small dimensions shall not be treated in the same charge,
neither shall timbers of differing stages of air seasoning, or the close-grained, be treated
in the same charge with coarse or open-grained timbers.

The timbers shall be subjected first to live steam superheated to from 250 to 275° Fahr., and
under a 30 to 40-lb. pressure. The live steam shall be admitted into the cylinders through
perforated steam pipes, and the temperature shall be obtained by using superheated steam in
closed pipes in the cylinders.

The length of time this steaming shall last will depend on the size of the timbers and the
length of time they have been cut. In piles and large timbers freshly cut, as long a time as
12 hours may be required. After the steaming is accomplished, the live steam shall be shut
off and the superheated steam shall be maintained at a temperature of 160° or more and a vacuum
of from 20 to 25 in. shall be held for 4 hours or longer, if the discharge from the pumps indicates
the necessity.

Oil Treatment.--The temperature being maintained at 160° Fahr., the cylinders shall be promptly
filled with creosote oil at a temperature as high as practicable (about 100° Fahr.). The oil
shall be maintained at a pressure ranging from 100 to 120 lb., as experience and measurements
must determine the length of time the oil treatment shall continue, so that the required amount
of oil may be injected.

After the required amount of oil is injected, the superheated steam shall be shut off, the
oil let out, the cylinders promptly opened at each end, and the timber immediately removed
from the cylinder.

In the erection of timbers the sap side must be turned up, and framing or cutting of timbers
shall not be permitted, if avoidable. All cut surfaces of timbers shall be saturated with hot
asphaltum, thinned with creosote oil. The heads of piles when cut shall be promptly coated
with the hot asphaltum and oil, even though the cut-off be temporary.

METHOD OF TESTING.

The tests were made on a Riehlé 100,000-lb. machine in the Experimental Engineering Laboratory
of Tulane University of Louisiana. The machine is provided with a cast-iron beam for cross-bending
tests. The distance between supports was 12 ft. The method of support was as follows: Each
end of the beam was provided with a steel roller which rested on the cast-iron beam of the
testing machine, while above the roller, and, directly under the beam tested, there was a steel
plate 6 by 8 in. in area and 1 in. thick. The area was sufficiently great to distribute the
load and prevent the shearing of the fibers of the wood. The head of the Riehlé machine is
10 in. wide. A plate, 3/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and 18 in. long, was placed between the head
of the machine and the beam tested.

==============================================

The deflection was measured on both sides of each beam by using silk threads stretched on each
side from nails driven about 2 in. above the bottom of the beam and directly over the rollers
which formed the supports. From a small piece of wood, tacked to the bottom of the beam at
its center and projecting at the sides, the distance to these threads was measured. These measurements
were taken to the nearest hundredth of an inch. The mean of the deflections was taken as the
true deflection for any load.

In computing the various quantities shown in Table 1, the summary of results, the load has
been assumed as concentrated at the center of the beam. While it is true that the load was
spread over a length of about 12 in., due to the width of the head of the machine and the plate
between it and the beam tested, it is also true that there were irregularities, such as bolt-holes
and, in some cases, abrasions due to wear, that could not well be taken into account. Hence,
it was deemed sufficiently accurate to consider the load as concentrated. Besides the horizontal
bolt-holes, shown in the photographs, there were vertical bolt-holes, at intervals in all the
beams. The latter were 7/8 in. in diameter, and in every case they were sufficiently removed
from the center of the length of the beam to allow the maximum moment at the reduced section
to be relatively less than that at the center of the beam. For this reason, no correction was
made for these holes. The broken beams often showed that rupture started at, or was influenced
by, some of the holes, especially the horizontal ones.

While some of the heavy oils of a tarry consistency remained, they were only to be found in
the sappy portions of the long-leaf pine and in the loblolly (Specimens II and IV). Exposure
in a semi-tropical climate for 26 years had resulted in the removal of the more volatile portions
of the creosote oil. The penetration of the oil into the sap wood seemed to be perfect, while
in the loblolly it varied from a fraction of an inch to 1-1/2 in. In the heart wood there was
very little penetration across the grain. The timber had been framed and the holes bored before
treatment. The penetration of the creosote along the grain from the holes was often from 4 to 6 in.

Circular 39 of the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled "Experiments on
the Strength of Treated Timber," gives the results of a great many tests of creosoted ties,
principally loblolly pine, from which the following conclusions are quoted:

     "(1) A high degree of steaming is injurious to wood. [Tables 3 and 4.]

     "(3) The presence of creosote will not weaken wood of itself. Since
     apparently it is present only in the openings of the cells, and
     does not get into the cell walls, its action can only be to retard
     the seasoning of the wood." [Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.]

COMPARISONS.

A comparison of the results obtained with tests made on untreated timber is interesting, and
to this end Tables 2 and 3, from Circular 115, Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture,
by W. Kendrick Hatt, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., are quoted. The tests made by the writer were
from timber raised in Louisiana and Mississippi, while the tests quoted were from timber raised
farther north. The number of tests was not sufficient to settle questions of average strength
or other qualities. It will be seen, however, that the treated timber 26 years old compares
favorably with the new untreated timber.
