When two similar phenomena differ from one another on any side, the discord brought about by
this difference is more apparent and more striking by reason of the closer conjunction of these
phenomena. By way of compensation the dissimilarity is less appreciable in proportion as these
phenomena are farther apart from each other.

This is rigorously logical and perfectly conformable to reason; yet there are cases where we
must affirm the contrary. Thus the same sound produced, I will suppose, by two flutes not in
accord with one another, forms those disagreeable pulsations in the air which discordant sounds
inevitably produce. There seems to be no doubt that by gradually bringing these discordant
instruments together, the falseness of their relation must be more and more striking, more
and more intolerable. Wrong! For then, and above all if the mouths of these instruments be
concentrically directed, a mutual translocation is produced between the two discordant sounds,
which restores the accuracy of their agreement. Thus the lower sound is raised, while the higher
one is lowered, in such a way that the two sounds are mingled on meeting and form a perfect
unison. Now, here are contrasts, which, contrary to all rational data, so far from being exaggerated
by contact, diminish gradually, until they are utterly annihilated. Thus, then, given two instruments
of the same nature, if the harmony which they effect be true, they enter by reason of their
conjunction into a negative state which neutralizes their sonority; while the contrary occurs
in the case of false unison. Here the instruments become identical with one another, the sonority
is increased and the tonal deviation is corrected to the most perfect harmony.

Obstinate rationalists, what is your logic worth here? Has it armed you against the surprises
held in store for you by a multitude of facts inaccordant with your reasonings? Oh, proud and
haughty reason, bow your head! Confess the inanity of your ways. Bow yet, once again, and contemplate
the mystery whence luminous instruction shall beam for you!

At bottom these mysteries may surprise and baffle a reason deprived of principle; but they
are never contrary to it, because they proceed from reason itself, from that Supreme Reason
which created us in its own image; and, by that very fact, is always in accord with individual
reason in so far as this will consent to sacrifice its own prejudices to it, or listen to its
infallible lessons.

But man's reason most frequently heeds itself alone. Thence, once again, arise its infirmities.
Thus, what will happen, if, because the truths which I utter here are obscure and do not at
the first glance appear to conform to the requirements of logic, you hastily reject them with
all the loftiness of your scornful reason, which would blush to admit what it did not understand!
Poor reason! which in and of itself understands so little, and admits so many follies as soon
as a scholar affirms them. The consequence will be that you will be strengthened in the error
which flatters your ignorance. Behold that proud reason which would never bend before a mystery
revealed, behold it, I say, bowed beneath the weight of prejudices, which there will be more
than one scholar, more than one logician, ready to endorse.

Thus reason will refuse as unworthy itself, all belief in the actions of God or of unseen spirits,
the angels, heaven, but will not dare to doubt the existence of moving atoms, invisible corpuscles.
This is the mental poverty into which the enemies of religious faith unwittingly fall. They
pervert that instrument of reason whose true use is to supplement and fortify imperfect intelligence,
and misuse it to discredit and overthrow the original intuitions of intelligence.

Random Notes.

    Type--Man.
    Prototype--Angel.
    Archetype--God.

It is within himself that man should find the reason of all he studies. In the angels he should
find the secret of his being: they are his prototypes. Lastly, it is in the Divine archetype
that we are to look for the universal reason.

The soul is a triple virtue, which, by means of the powers that it governs, forms, develops
and modifies the sum total of the constituent forces of the body.

The body is that combination of co-penetrating forces whose inherent powers govern all acts
under the triple impulse of the constituent forces of the being.

The immanences are powers which, under the impulse of the constituent virtues of the being,
govern and modify the co-penetrating forces of the body.

The powers govern the forces under the impulse of the virtues.

The virtues are the impulses under the sway of which the powers govern and direct the forces.

Science and art form two means of assimilation: The one by means of absorption, the other by
means of emanation. The one, more generous than the other, gives and communicates; the other
unceasingly receives and appeals. Science receives, art gives. By science man assimilates the
world; by art he assimilates himself to the world. Assimilation is to science what incarnation
is to art.

If science perpetuates things in us, art perpetuates us in things and causes us to survive therein.

If by science man makes himself preëminent in subjugating the things of this world, by art
he renders them supernatural by impressing upon them the living characters of his being and
of his soul.

Art is an act by which life lives again in that which in itself has no life.

Art should move the secret springs of life, convince the mind and persuade the heart.

    Beauty purifies the sense,
    Truth illuminates the mind,
    Virtue sanctifies the soul.

The more lofty the intellect, the more simple the speech. (So in art.)

Accent is the modulation of the soul.

The artist who does not love, is by that fact rendered sterile.

Art is a regenerating or delighting power.

a mysterious hand to caress the hearer.

Nothing is more deplorable than a gesture without a motive.

Perhaps the best gesture is that which is least apparent.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is always voice enough to an attentive listener.

       *       *       *       *       *

Persuade yourself that there are blind men and deaf men in your audience whom you must move,
interest and persuade! Your inflection must become pantomime to the blind, and your pantomime,
inflection to the deaf.

       *       *       *       *       *

The mouth plays a part in everything evil which we would express, by a grimace which consists
of protruding the lips and lowering the corners. If the grimace translates a concentric sentiment,
it should be made by compressing the lips.

       *       *       *       *       *

Conscious menace--that of a master to his subordinate--is expressed by a movement of the head
carried from above downward.

Impotent menace requires the head to be moved from below upward.

       *       *       *       *       *

Any interrogation made with crossed arms must partake of the character of a threat.

       *       *       *       *       *

When two limbs follow the same direction, they cannot be simultaneous without an injury to
the law of opposition. Therefore, direct movements should be successive, and opposite movements
should be simultaneous.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are three great articular centres: the shoulder, elbow and wrist. Passional expression
passes from the shoulder, where it is in the emotional state, to the elbow, where it is presented
in the affectional state; then to the wrist and the thumb, where it is presented in the susceptive
and volitional state.

       *       *       *       *       *

Three centres in the arm: the shoulder for pathetic actions; the elbow, which approaches the
body by reason of humility, and reciprocally (that is, inversely) for pride; lastly, the hand
for fine, spiritual and delicate actions.

       *       *       *       *       *

The initial forms of movements should be--in virtue of the zones whence they proceed--the only
explicit, and consequently the only truly expressive ones.

       *       *       *       *       *

Bad actors exert themselves in vain to be moved and to afford a spectacle to themselves. On
the other hand, true artists never let their gestures reveal more than a tenth part of the
secret emotion that they apparently feel and would hide from the audience to spare their sensibility.
Thus they succeed in stirring all spectators.

       *       *       *       *       *

No, art is not an imitation of nature: art is better than nature. It is nature illuminated.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are two kinds of loud voices: the vocally loud, which is the vulgar voice; and the dynamically
loud, which is the powerful voice. A voice, however powerful it may be, should be inferior
to the power which animates it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Every object of agreeable or disagreeable aspect which surprises us, makes the body recoil.
The degree of reaction should be proportionate to the degree of emotion caused by the sight
of the object.

       *       *       *       *       *

Without abnegation, no truth for the artist. We should not preoccupy the audience with our
own personality. There is no true, simple or expressive singing without self-denial. We must
often leave people in ignorance of our own good qualities.

       *       *       *       *       *

To use expression at random on our own authority, expression at all hazards, is absurd.

       *       *       *       *       *

The mouth is a vital thermometer, the nose a moral thermometer.

       *       *       *       *       *

Dynamic wealth depends upon the number of articulations brought into play; the fewer articulations
an actor uses, the more closely he approaches the puppet.

       *       *       *       *       *

A portion of a whole cannot be seriously appreciated by any one ignorant of the constitution
of that whole.

       *       *       *       *       *

An abstract having been made of the modes of execution which the artist should learn before
handling a subject, two things are first of all requisite:

1. To know what he is to seek in that subject itself;

2. To know how to find what he seeks.

       *       *       *       *       *

Is not the essential principle of art the union of truth, beauty and good? Are its action and
aim anything but a tendency toward the realization of these three terms?

       *       *       *       *       *

We have a right to ask a work of art by what methods it claims to move us, by which side of
our character it intends to interest and convince us.

       *       *       *       *       *

Speech is external, and visible thought is the ambassadress of the intellect.

       *       *       *       *       *

How should the invisible be visible when the visible is so little so!

       *       *       *       *       *

One cannot be too careful of his articulation. The initial consonant should be articulated
distinctly; the spirit of the word is contained in it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two things to be observed in the consonant: its explosion and its preparation. The t, d, p,
etc., keep us waiting; the ch, v, j, prepare themselves, as: "vvvenez." The vocals ne, me,
re are muffled.

       *       *       *       *       *

Rhythm is that which asserts; it is the form of movement.

Melody is that which distinguishes.

Harmony is that which conjoins.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let your attitude, gesture and face foretell what you would make felt.

       *       *       *       *       *

Be wary of the tremolo which many singers mistake for vibration.

       *       *       *       *       *

If you cannot conquer your defect, make it beloved.

       *       *       *       *       *

A movement should never be mixed with a facial twist.

       *       *       *       *       *

Things that are said quietly should sing themselves in the utterance.

Part Sixth.

Lecture and Lessons Given by Mme. Géraldy (Delsarte's Daughter) in America.

Lecture

Delivered by Mme. Géraldy at the Berkeley Lyceum, New York, February 6, 1892.

Ladies:

When I made up my mind to come to this country it was not with the object of exhibiting myself,
but to speak to you of my father. In your country my father is much talked of. In my country,
unfortunately, he is forgotten. My father did not write anything--that is a terrible thing!
He expected to do so some day, but he always put it off. At last he decided to do so during
the war--our unfortunate war! He did not have many lessons to give at that time, for nobody
thought of taking any. This gave him leisure to write. His work was to have borne the title,
"My Revelatory Episodes." He had only written five chapters when he died. It was to bring to
you these five chapters that I came to America. But as soon as I began to speak of them I was
stopped. "Why do you tell us this?" they said; "we know all this already." I then discovered
that the books written on my father by the Abbé Delaumosne and by Mme. Angélique Arnaud had
been translated and published in this country. Mme. Arnaud's book is the better of the two,
but it is not practical--not at all practical.
