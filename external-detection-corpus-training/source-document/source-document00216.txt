No. III. JANUARY 1876.

THE STATE OF THE OSSIANIC CONTROVERSY.

[CONTINUED.]

MR ARNOLD in that handsome, but slightly ambiguous admission of his, that the Celts in their
intellectual capacity come very near the secret of nature and of natural magic, does not seem
to imply more in reality than that they have a subtler sense of certain natural affinities
than their Anglo-Saxon brethren have; that they apprehend more surely when, where, and how
the truest impress of physical nature occurs on the percipient faculties of the soul, than
men of a more phlegmatic constitution do; and that they can draw from such intuitions of their
own a sort of inspiration, or second-sight of nature, comparable to prophecy, which gives their
highest poetic utterance a rapt enthusiasm--and the accuracy of this estimate need not be disputed,
but, so far as Ossian is concerned, it must be considerably extended. To read Ossian as we
do, from the text of Macpherson, there was another sort of insight, purely scientific, into
the mysteries of nature, inherited and expressed by him; a certain acquaintance with her hidden
powers, and a certain augury of her possible future development, if men could only attain to
it, far beyond the mere rapt enthusiasm of a poet, or the so-called second-sight of a seer.
Whether this peculiar faith of his was derived by tradition, and if so, from whom; or whether
it was the result of practical experiment in his own generation, is foreign for the moment
to our present inquiry. But that it was relied upon as an endowment of the most gifted heroes;
that it was exercised by them in extremity, as if to subdue nature from whom they had borrowed
it, and to wrest the very power of destruction out of her hand; and that such practical conquest
was sometimes achieved by them, or is said to have been achieved by them, is just as certain
as that Macpherson's translation is before us now. What we refer to more especially for the
present, is the secret of extracting or discharging electricity from the atmosphere by mechanical
means--by the thrust of a spear, or of a sword, into the bosom of the low-hanging cloud, or
lurid vapour, and so dislodging the imaginary spirit of evil by which they were supposed to
be tenanted. Only the very best, and bravest, and wisest could prevail in such conflict with
nature; but they did prevail, according to Ossian; and the weapons of their warfare, and the
mode of their assault, were precisely similar to what an experimentalist in electricity might
employ at the present day, or to what the Egyptians employed in the days of Moses. We shall
not now go further back in the prosecution of this inquiry, but would seriously recommend the
reader who has any difficulty on the subject to compare, at his leisure, the work of Moses
on the top of Mount Sinai and elsewhere, with an Egyptian "rod" in his hand, and the exploits
of Fingal in conflict with the Spirit of Loda on the heights of Hoy, with a sword in his hand.
There might have been a far-derived and long traditional secret connection between the two,
most edifying, or at least most curious, to investigate; or they might both have resulted from
that sort of intuition which only the most gifted of any nation enjoy independently, re-appearing
again in Franklin, and now familiarised to the world. Let those who doubt, or who differ on
this point, satisfy themselves. What we are now concerned to maintain and prove is, that the
fact is more than once described by Ossian, in circumstances, in situations, and with instrumentalities,
which render the allegation of it at least indubitable. In the case above referred to, for
example, Fingal, challenged and assaulted in a thunderstorm by the Spirit of Loda, encounters
his antagonist with a sword, on the very verge of a cliff overhanging the Atlantic; and by
one or two scientific thrusts, with incredible daring, disarms the cloud, dissipates the storm,
and sends his atmospheric adversary shrieking down the wind with such violence that "Innistore
shook at the sound; the waves heard it on the deep, and stopped on their course with fear."
The scene is described in that well-known passage in Carric-Thura, which Macpherson himself
characterises as "the most extravagant fiction in all Ossian's poems."

Now the question as regards the authenticity or reliability of this very passage, is whether
Macpherson understood the meaning of it; what it represented, where the conflict occurred,
or how it happened? It has been sufficiently demonstrated elsewhere--in "Ossian and the Clyde,"
pp. 311-324--that the encounter took place near the celebrated "Dwarfie Stone" on the western
headland of Hoy in the Orkneys--a region more remarkable for its sudden electric gatherings
and violent atmospheric currents than almost any other in Great Britain, and at that particular
spot so much so, that the very scene described in Ossian has been selected by Walter Scott
for a similar electrical display in the "Pirate." But of this obvious fact, and of all that
is connected with it in his own translation, Macpherson is so ignorant that he not only does
not point it out, but does not understand it, and cannot even conjecture where it was. His
great antagonist Laing is equally at fault on the subject, and by way of exposing, as he believes,
the dishonesty of Macpherson, endeavours to show that in patching up his account Macpherson
had mistaken Thurso for Thura. Macpherson, in fact, knew nothing either about Thurso or Thura--even
less than Laing did; and it is only in the work above cited that either the scene has been
identified, or the encounter explained.

Here, then, is a question, not of linguistic criticism, but of scientific fact--of geographical
position, of atmospheric agency--which should be disposed of on its own merits, and which,
like many others of the same sort, must ultimately transfer the whole inquiry to a much higher
field than that of syllables and syntax.

But the description in question, it may be objected, is very much exaggerated, and therefore
cannot be relied on: which is the very objection Macpherson himself urged--that it is "the
most extravagant fiction in all Ossian's poems." But if that was the case in his opinion, how
could the passage be his own? It was easy enough either to remedy or explain it, if he could
explain it, or not to introduce it. On the other hand, when rightly understood, there is no
undue exaggeration in the account at all--not more than might be reasonably expected from a
poet of the highest sensibility and the most vivid imagination in describing an incomprehensible
natural phenomenon; not more, for example, than in "the sound of a trumpet and the voice of
words" on Mount Sinai. Still it is not the question of descriptive exaggeration, but of scientific
fact, that is now before us; and if the whole of the so-called conflict of Fingal with the
Prince of the Power of the Air on Roraheid in Hoy was so utterly inexplicable to Macpherson,
both as to place and character, that he speaks of it hopelessly as a story "concerning ghosts,"
on what principle of critical consistency, or of common sense, can he be said to have been
the author of it? If the Septuagint translators, for example, had added a note of their own
on the giving of the Law at Sinai, to the effect that it appeared "the most extravagant fiction"
to them, at the same time transferring, in defiance of their own text, the entire scene from
one end of the Red Sea to the other, would any reader in his senses accuse the Seventy of having
fabricated not only the two chapters in question, but the whole Book of Exodus--even although
the original had been now lost? Their very simplicity and ignorance would have acquitted them.
Yet Macpherson, in similar circumstances, is to be held guilty, although he could have more
easily cleared himself by altering or omitting the whole passage, than a man in London could
prove by an alibi that he had been guilty of no forgery at Inverness or Edinburgh six hours
before! But if this hitherto incomprehensible passage in Ossian be genuine then the entire
poem of Carric-Thura, which is identified with it in every word and syllable from beginning
to end, must be genuine also.

In the same sort of field, but without the addition of supernatural agency, we have another
scene of scientific import in the War of Inisthona. Inisthona, according to Macpherson, was
on the coast of Norway--he did not know where; Inisthona, according to Laing, was a wilful
corruption of Inis-owen in Lough Foyle; Inisthona, in point of fact, was Iceland--as clearly
and distinctly so in Macpherson's own text, as latitude, longitude, and physical configuration
can make it; far more distinctly recognisable than any Ultima Thule of the Romans. But here,
in this Inisthona, we have first a fountain surrounded with mossy stones, in a grassy vale,
at the head of a bay; then a wilderness of half a day's journey inland; then a lake at the
end of the wilderness, exhaling pestilential vapours, called Lake Lano--but no volcano visible
as yet: and in Iceland we have still the basin of the fountain, surrounded with its mossy stones,
petrified and dried up by volcanic heat, at the head of the bay; we have still the dreary wilderness
beyond it, now scorched and blackened, ending in the Plain of Thingvalla, where the King of
Denmark was entertained more than a twelvemonth ago; we have still the lake beyond that, where
it should be, but now relieved of its sulphurous vapours by eruptive jets of steam in its neighbourhood;
and besides, we have now Mount Hecla in active operation, by whose accumulated fires and dreadful
discharges, since Ossian's day, the whole island has been torn and desolated. Here, therefore,
again, the same question of fact arises, and must be disposed of by all reasonable inquirers.
In this one identification we have geography, geology, history, and navigation combined, beyond
Macpherson's own comprehension--earthquakes, subterranean fires, latent volcanic forces; a
beautiful island where there is now desolation; and a warlike people occupying its soil, subject
to the Danes 600 years and more before the Danes themselves are supposed to have discovered
it. In the face of such a revelation as this, nowhere else to be found but in Ossian, what
does it signify that the Gaelic text of Inisthona has perished? The fact that it survives in
English is only a greater miracle, for which we are indebted solely to the patience and fidelity
of a man who has been called a liar and an impostor.

One more miracle has yet to be added in the same field--viz., that Lake Lego or Lough Neagh
in Ireland, and Lake Lano in Iceland, both emitting pestilential vapours, are geographically
connected in Ossian with subterranean volcanic movements which pass from Ireland, by the west
coast of Scotland, through the Orkneys to Inisthona; and thus the latest theories of the most
accomplished geologists have been anticipated more than a hundred years before their announcement,
by the work of a man who is supposed to have had no original to guide him, and who himself
had not the remotest idea of what his own words conveyed.

It remains then, after such illustrations, for those who still deny the authenticity of Ossian
to declare whether they have ever studied him; and for those who still wrangle about the style
of Macpherson's so-called Gaelic to decide whether they will continue such petty warfare among
vowels and consonants, and ill-spelt medi疆val legends, when the science, the history, the navigation,
the atmospheric phenomena, and the impending volcanic changes of Western Europe fifteen hundred
years ago, are all unveiled and detailed, with an accuracy and a minuteness beyond cavil or
competition, in the matchless English translation before them. Will our most erudite grammarians
never understand? Would they abandon Genesis, shall we say, because Elohim and Jehovah are
sometimes interchanged in the text? Can they believe that any Jew, who could concoct a book
like Genesis, did not also know that Elohim was a plural noun? Can they any more, then, believe
that a Celtic man with brains enough to fabricate poems like Fingal and Temora did not know
that the Gaelic name for the sun was feminine? Can they see no other way of accounting for
such alleged variations of gender, and number, and case, than by forgery, when the very forger
himself must have seen them? Or do they seriously prefer some letter of the Gaelic alphabet
to a law of nature? Will they forego the facts of an epoch, for the orthography of a syllable?
If so, then the friends of Ossian, who is one great mass of facts, must turn once more to the
common sense of the public, and leave his etymological detractors at leisure to indulge their
own predilections, and to entertain one another.

In the present aspect of the controversy, indeed, the only antagonists entitled to anything
like a patient hearing are the respectable, perhaps venerable, geologists and antiquarians
who still lodge or linger about the Roman Wall; who talk, with a solemn air, about stern facts;
who are also fortified by the authority of Hugh Miller and Smith of Jordanhill, and are led
on to continuous defeat on their own ground, under the auspices of the Scotsman, who knows
well how to shut the door politely in any man's face who pursues them. These gentlemen are
far from being either unimportant or unworthy antagonists, if they would only speak intelligently
for themselves and not allow their credit to be usurped by some nameless reviewer in a newspaper,
who may know less about the whole matter in dispute than they do about Sanscrit. But let them
have patience. Their favourite haunts, and impregnable strongholds, about Dunglass and Duntocher,
shall be investigated with religious care; and the waters of the Clyde, as high as they will
honestly flow, let in upon them without ceremony or remorse. As for the others, who, with no
great semblance of either grace or grammar to support them, persist in affirming, with point-blank
stolid effrontery, that Macpherson "must have been an impostor," and that Ossian is a "fudge"--they
may safely be consigned in silence to their legitimate fate.

TO PROFESSOR JOHN STUART BLACKIE.

A LOCHABER LILT.

    A health to thee, Stuart Blackie!
      (I drink it in mountain dew)
    With all the kindliest greetings
      Of a heart that is leal and true.
    Let happen what happen may
      With others, by land or sea;
    For me, I vow if I drink at all,
      I'll drink a health to thee.

    A health to thee, Stuart Blackie!
      A man of men art thou,
    With thy lightsome step and form erect,
      And thy broad and open brow;
    With thy eagle eye and ringing voice
      (Which yet can be soft and kind),
    As wrapped in thy plaid thou passest by
      With thy white locks in the wind!

    I greet thee as poet and scholar;
      I greet thee as wise and good;
    I greet thee ever lord of thyself--
      No heritage mean, by the rood!
    I greet thee and hold thee in honour,
      That thou bendest to no man's nod--
    Amidst the din of a world of sin,
      Still lifting thine eye to God!

    Go, search me the world and find me;
      Go, find me if you can,
    From the distant Far�s with their mists and snows,
      To the green-clad Isle of Man;
    From John O' Groats to Maidenkirk,
      From far Poolewe to Prague--
    Go, find me a better or wiser man
      Than the Laird of Altnacraig.

    Now, here's to the honest and leal and true,
      And here's to the learned and wise,
    And to all who love our Highland glens
      And our Bens that kiss the skies;
    And here's to the native Celtic race,
      And to each bright-eyed Celtic fair;
    And here's to the Chief of Altnacraig--
      And hurrah! for the Celtic Chair!

                                                       NETHER-LOCHABER.

GENERAL SIR ALAN CAMERON, K.C.B.,

COLONEL 79th CAMERON HIGHLANDERS.

A POPULAR writer[A] of the past generation, in some introductory observations to his historical
essay, makes the following on Scotland and its natives:--Considering the limited population
and extent of that country, it has made a distinguished figure in history. No country in modern
times has produced characters more remarkable for learning, valour, or ability, or for knowledge
in the most important arts, both of peace and of war; and though the natives of that formerly
independent, and hitherto unconquered kingdom, have every reason to be proud of the name of
Britons, which they have acquired since the Union; yet they ought not to relinquish all remembrance
of the martial achievements, and the honourable characteristics of their ancestors. Acting
on the recommendation embodied in the foregoing quotation; and as the conductors of the Celtic
Magazine have intimated their intention of making biographies form occasionally part of its
contents, the following sketch of one who, in his day was not the least distinguished among
our Highland countrymen, but of whose eminent services to his country, little or nothing has
appeared, may prove interesting. Biography is admitted to be one of the most interesting sections
of literature. We therefore trust that this feature in the Magazine will be appreciated. The
field will be found extensive, inasmuch that, happily for the country, its benefactors have
been numerous, the record of whose deeds deserve to be remembered in this Celtic periodical
for the entertainment, and may be, the emulation of its readers.

The details of the life and public services of the gallant gentleman now submitted, and deserving
record, are supplied partly from oral information collected at intervals, and partly from documents
received by the writer, but which, although imperfect, it is hoped may be acceptable, even
at this distance since the lifetime of the subject.
