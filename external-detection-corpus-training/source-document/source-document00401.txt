Every reader of the Archæologia knows so well the great value of the papers contained in it
(too few in number) by the Rev. John Webb, that he will be sure that any work edited by that
gentleman will be edited with diligence, intelligence, and learning. Such is the Roll of the
Household Expenses of Richard de Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford, during part of the Years 1289
and 1290, which he has just edited for the Camden Society, in a manner every way worthy of
his reputation, which is that of one of the best antiquaries of the day. The present volume
contains only the Roll, its endorsement, and an appendix of contemporary and explanatory documents,
the whole being richly annotated by the editor. Another volume will contain his introduction,
glossary, &c. On its completion we shall again call attention to a work which is so creditable
both to Mr. Webb and to the Camden Society.

The third volume of the cheap and handsome library edition of The Works of Oliver Goldsmith,
edited by Peter Cunningham, F.S.A., which forms a portion of Murray's British Classics, contains
I. The Bee; II. Essays; III. Unacknowledged Essays; and IV. His Prefaces, Introductions, &c.

Our photographic friends will be glad to hear that a new edition of Professor Hunt's Manual
of Photography has just been issued, in which the author, besides including all the most recent
improvements, the process of photographic etching, &c., has taken the opportunity of making
such alterations in the arrangements of the several divisions of the subject, as have enabled
him to place the various phenomena in a clearer view.

While on the subject of scientific publications, we notice the very able volume just issued
by Professor Beale, The Microscope, and its Application to Clinical Medicine. Though addressed
more particularly to medical practitioners, it contains so much valuable instruction with respect
to the management of the microscope generally, as to render it a valuable guide to all who
are engaged in microscopic investigations.

Dr. Latham will lecture on Thursday next at the Beaumont Institution, Mile End Road, On the
various Families of Mankind in the Russian and Turkish Empires. The Lecture is for the benefit
of the Colet Schools of the very poor district of St. Thomas, Stepney.
