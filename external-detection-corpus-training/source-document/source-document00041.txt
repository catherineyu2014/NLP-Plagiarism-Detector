~Chromates.~ When a chromium compound is fused with an alkali and an oxidizing agent a chromate
is produced. When potassium hydroxide is used as the alkali the equation is

    2Cr(OH){3} + 4KOH + 3O = 2K{2}CrO{4} + 5H{2}O.

This reaction recalls the formation of a manganate under similar conditions.

~Properties of chromates.~ The chromates are salts of the unstable chromic acid (H{2}CrO{4}),
and as a rule are yellow in color. Lead chromate (PbCrO{4}) is the well-known pigment chrome
yellow. Most of the chromates are insoluble and can therefore be prepared by precipitation.
Thus, when a solution of potassium chromate is added to solutions of lead nitrate and barium
nitrate respectively, the reactions expressed by the following equations occur:

    Pb(NO{3}){2} + K{2}CrO{4} = PbCrO{4} + 2KNO{3},

    Ba(NO{3}){2} + K{2}CrO{4} = BaCrO{4} + 2KNO{3}.

The chromates of lead and barium separate as yellow precipitates. The presence of either of
these two metals can be detected by taking advantage of these reactions.

~Dichromates.~ When potassium chromate is treated with an acid the potassium salt of the unstable
dichromic acid (H{2}Cr{2}O{7}) is formed:

    2K{2}CrO{4} + H{2}SO{4} = K{2}Cr{2}O{7} + K{2}SO{4} + H{2}O.

The relation between the chromates and dichromates is the same as that between the phosphates
and the pyrophosphates. Potassium dichromate might therefore be called potassium pyrochromate.

~Potassium dichromate~ (K{2}Cr{2}O{7}). This is the best known dichromate, and is the most
familiar chromium compound. It forms large crystals of a brilliant red color, and is rather
sparingly soluble in water. When treated with potassium hydroxide it is converted into the chromate

    K{2}Cr{2}O{7} + 2KOH = 2K{2}CrO{4} + H{2}O.

When added to a solution of lead or barium salt the corresponding chromates (not dichromates)
are precipitated. With barium nitrate the equation is

    2Ba(NO{3}){2} + K{2}Cr{2}O{7} + H{2}O
        = 2BaCrO{4} + 2KNO{3} + 2HNO{3}.

Potassium dichromate finds use in many industries as an oxidizing agent, especially in the
preparation of organic substances, such as the dye alizarin, and in the construction of several
varieties of electric batteries.

     ~Sodium chromates.~ The reason why the potassium salt rather than
     the sodium compound is used is that sodium chromate and
     dichromate are so soluble that it is hard to prepare them pure.
     This difficulty is being overcome now, and the sodium compounds
     are replacing the corresponding potassium salts. This is of
     advantage, since a sodium salt is cheaper than a potassium
     salt, so far as raw materials go.

~Oxidizing action of chromates and dichromates.~ When a dilute solution of a chromate or dichromate
is acidified with an acid, such as sulphuric acid, no reaction apparently takes place. However,
if there is present a third substance capable of oxidation, the chromium compound gives up
a portion of its oxygen to this substance. Since the chromate changes into a dichromate in
the presence of an acid, it will be sufficient to study the action of the dichromates alone.
The reaction takes place in two steps.

By combining equations (1) and (2), the following is obtained:

    K{2}Cr{2}O{7} + 7H{2}SO{4} + 6FeSO{4}
       = K{2}SO{4} + Cr{2}(SO{4}){3} + 3Fe{2}(SO{4}){3} + 7H{2}0.

This reaction is often employed in the estimation of iron in iron ores.

     ~Potassium chrome alum.~ It will be noticed that the oxidizing
     action of potassium dichromate leaves potassium sulphate and
     chromium sulphate as the products of the reaction. On
     evaporating the solution these substances crystallize out as
     potassium chrome alum, which substance is produced as a
     by-product in the industries using potassium dichromate for
     oxidizing purposes.

~Chromic anhydride~ (CrO{3}). When concentrated sulphuric acid is added to a strong solution
of potassium dichromate, and the liquid allowed to stand, deep red needle-shaped crystals appear
which have the formula CrO{3}.This oxide of chromium is called chromic anhydride, since it
combines readily with water to form chromic acid:

    CrO{3} + H{2}O = H{2}CrO{4}.

It is therefore analogous to sulphur trioxide which forms sulphuric acid in a similar way:

    SO{3} + H{2}O = H{2}SO{4}.

Chromic anhydride is a very strong oxidizing agent, giving up oxygen and forming chromic oxide:

    2CrO{3} = Cr{2}O{3} + 3O.

     ~Rare elements of the family.~ Molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium
     are three rather rare elements belonging in the same family
     with chromium, and form many compounds which are similar in
     formulas to the corresponding compounds of chromium. They can
     play the part of metals and also form acids resembling chromic
     acid in formula. Thus we have molybdic acid (H{2}MoO{4}), the
     ammonium salt of which is (NH{4}){2}MoO{4}. This salt has
     the property of combining with phosphoric acid to form a very
     complex substance which is insoluble in nitric acid. On this
     account molybdic acid is often used in the estimation of the
     phosphoric acid present in a substance. Like chromium, the
     metals are difficult to prepare in pure condition. Alloys with
     iron can be prepared by reducing the mixed oxides with carbon
     in an electric furnace; these alloys are used to some extent in
     preparing special kinds of steel.

==============================================================================

~The family.~ Following iron, nickel, and cobalt in the eighth column of the periodic table
are two groups of three elements each. The metals of the first of these groups--ruthenium,
rhodium, and palladium--have atomic weights near 100 and densities near 12. The metals of the
other group--iridium, osmium, and platinum--have atomic weights near 200 and densities near
21. These six rare elements have very similar physical properties and resemble each other chemically
not only in the type of compounds which they form but also in the great variety of them. They
occur closely associated in nature, usually as alloys of platinum in the form of irregular
metallic grains in sand and gravel. Platinum is by far the most abundant of the six.

Although the periodic classification assigns gold to the silver-copper group, its physical
as well as many of its chemical properties much more closely resemble those of the platinum
metals, and it can he conveniently considered along with them. The four elements gold, platinum,
osmium, and iridium are the heaviest substances known, being about twice as heavy as lead.

PLATINUM

~Occurrence.~ About 90% of the platinum of commerce comes from Russia, small amounts being
produced in California, Brazil, and Australia.

~Preparation.~ Native platinum is usually alloyed with gold and the platinum metals. To separate
the platinum the alloy is dissolved in aqua regia, which converts the platinum into chloroplatinic
acid (H{2}PtCl{6}). Ammonium chloride is then added, which precipitates the platinum as insoluble
ammonium chloroplatinate:

    H{2}PtCl{6} + 2NH{4}Cl = (NH{4}){2}PtCl{6} + 2HCl.

Some iridium is also precipitated as a similar compound. On ignition the double chloride is
decomposed, leaving the platinum as a spongy metallic mass, which is melted in an electric
furnace and rolled or hammered into the desired shape.

~Physical properties.~ Platinum is a grayish-white metal of high luster, and is very malleable
and ductile. It melts in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe and in the electric furnace; it is harder
than gold and is a good conductor of electricity. In finely divided form it has the ability
to absorb or occlude gases, especially oxygen and hydrogen. These gases, when occluded, are
in a very active condition resembling the nascent state, and can combine with each other at
ordinary temperatures. A jet of hydrogen or coal gas directed upon spongy platinum is at once
ignited.

     ~Platinum as a catalytic agent.~ Platinum is remarkable for its
     property of acting as a catalytic agent in a large number of
     chemical reactions, and mention has been made of this use of
     the metal in connection with the manufacture of sulphuric acid.
     When desired for this purpose some porous or fibrous substance,
     such as asbestos, is soaked in a solution of platinic chloride
     and then ignited. The platinum compound is decomposed and the
     platinum deposited in very finely divided form. Asbestos
     prepared in this way is called platinized asbestos. The
     catalytic action seems to be in part connected with the
     property of absorbing gases and rendering them nascent. Some
     other metals possess this same power, notably palladium, which
     is remarkable for its ability to absorb hydrogen.

~Chemical properties.~ Platinum is a very inactive element chemically, and is not attacked
by any of the common acids. Aqua regia slowly dissolves it, forming platinic chloride (PtCl{4}),
which in turn unites with the hydrochloric acid present in the aqua regia, forming the compound
chloroplatinic acid (H{2}PtCl{6}). Platinum is attacked by fused alkalis. It combines at higher
temperatures with carbon and phosphorus and alloys with many metals. It is readily attacked
by chlorine but not by oxidizing agents.

~Applications.~ Platinum is very valuable as a material for the manufacture of chemical utensils
which are required to stand a high temperature or the action of strong reagents. Platinum crucibles,
dishes, forceps, electrodes, and similar articles are indispensable in the chemical laboratory.
In the industries it is used for such purposes as the manufacture of pans for evaporating sulphuric
acid, wires for sealing through incandescent light bulbs, and for making a great variety of
instruments. Unfortunately the supply of the metal is very limited, and the cost is steadily
advancing, so that it is now more valuable than gold.

~Compounds.~ Platinum forms two series of salts of which platinous chloride (PtCl{2}) and platinic
chloride (PtCl{4}) are examples. Platinates are also known. While a great variety of compounds
of platinum have been made, the substance is chiefly employed in the metallic state.

~Platinic chloride (PtCl{4}).~ Platinic chloride is an orange-colored, soluble compound made
by heating chloroplatinic acid in a current of chlorine. If hydrochloric acid is added to a
solution of the substance, the two combine, forming chloroplatinic acid (H{2}PtCl{6}):

    2HCl + PtCl{4} = H{2}PtCl{6}.

The potassium and ammonium salts of this acid are nearly insoluble in water and alcohol. The
acid is therefore used as a reagent to precipitate potassium in analytical work. With potassium
chloride the equation is

    2KCl + H{2}PtCl{6} = K{2}PtCl{6} + 2HCl.

     ~Other metals of the family.~ The other members of the family
     have few applications. Iridium is used in the form of a
     platinum alloy, since the alloy is much harder than pure
     platinum and is even less fusible. This alloy is sometimes used
     to point gold pens. Osmium tetroxide (OsO{4}) is a very
     volatile liquid and is used under the name of osmic acid as a
     stain for sections in microscopy.

GOLD

~Occurrence.~ Gold has been found in many localities, the most famous being South Africa, Australia,
Russia, and the United States. In this country it is found in Alaska and in nearly half of
the states of the union, notably in California, Colorado, and Nevada. It is usually found in
the native condition, frequently alloyed with silver; in combination it is sometimes found
as telluride (AuTe{2}), and in a few other compounds.

~Mining.~ Native gold occurs in the form of small grains or larger nuggets in the sands of
old rivers, or imbedded in quartz veins in rocks. In the first case it is obtained in crude
form by placer mining. The sand containing the gold is shaken or stirred in troughs of running
waters called sluices. This sweeps away the sand but allows the heavier gold to sink to the
bottom of the sluice. Sometimes the sand containing the gold is washed away from its natural
location into the sluices by powerful streams of water delivered under pressure from pipes.
This is called hydraulic mining. In vein mining the gold-bearing quartz is mined from the veins,
stamped into fine powder in stamping mills, and the gold extracted by one of the processes
to be described.

~Extraction.~ 1. Amalgamation process. In the amalgamation process the powder containing the
gold is washed over a series of copper plates whose surfaces have been amalgamated with mercury.
The gold sticks to the mercury or alloys with it, and after a time the gold and mercury are
scraped off and the mixture is distilled. The mercury distills off and the gold is left in
the retort ready for refining.

2. Chlorination process. When gold occurs along with metallic sulphides it is often extracted
by chlorination. The ore is first roasted, and is then moistened and treated with chlorine.
This dissolves the gold but not the metallic oxides:

    Au + 3Cl = AuCl{3}.

The gold chloride, being soluble, is extracted from the mixture with water, and the gold is
precipitated from the solution, usually by adding ferrous sulphate:

    AuCl{3} + 3FeSO{4} = Au + FeCl{3} + Fe{2}(SO{4}){3}.

3. Cyanide process. This process depends upon the fact that gold is soluble in a solution of
potassium cyanide in the presence of the oxygen of the air. The powder from the stamping mills
is treated with a very dilute potassium cyanide solution which extracts the gold:

    2Au + 4KCN + H{2}O + O = 2KOH + 2KAu(CN){2}.

From this solution the gold can be obtained by electrolysis or by precipitation with metallic zinc:

    2KAu(CN){2} + Zn = K{2}Zn(CN){4} + 2Au.

~Refining of gold.~ Gold is refined by three general methods:

1. Electrolysis. When gold is dissolved in a solution of potassium cyanide, and the solution
electrolyzed, the gold is deposited in very pure condition on the cathode.

2. Cupellation. When the gold is alloyed with easily oxidizable metals, such as copper or lead,
it may be refined by cupellation. The alloy is fused with an oxidizing flame on a shallow hearth
made of bone ash, which substance has the property of absorbing metallic oxides but not the
gold. Any silver which may be present remains alloyed with the gold.

3. Parting with sulphuric acid. Gold may be separated from silver, as well as from many other
metals, by heating the alloy with concentrated sulphuric acid. This dissolves the silver, while
the gold is not attacked.

~Physical properties.~ Gold is a very heavy bright yellow metal, exceedingly malleable and
ductile, and a good conductor of electricity. It is quite soft and is usually alloyed with
copper or silver to give it the hardness required for most practical uses. The degree of fineness
is expressed in terms of carats, pure gold being twenty-four carats; the gold used for jewelry
is usually eighteen carats, eighteen parts being gold and six parts copper or silver. Gold
coinage is 90% gold and 10% copper.

~Chemical properties.~ Gold is not attacked by any one of the common acids; aqua regia easily
dissolves it, forming gold chloride (AuCl{3}), which in turn combines with hydrochloric acid
to form chlorauric acid (HAuCl{4}). Fused alkalis also attack it. Most oxidizing agents are
without action upon it, and in general it is not an active element.

     ~Compounds.~ The compounds of gold, though numerous and varied in
     character, are of comparatively little importance and need not
     be described in detail. The element forms two series of salts
     in which it acts as a metal: in the aurous series the gold is
     univalent, the chloride having the formula AuCl; in the auric
     series it is trivalent, auric chloride having the formula
     AuCl{3}. Gold also acts as an acid-forming element, forming
     such compounds as potassium aurate (KAuO{2}). Its compounds
     are very easily decomposed, however, metallic gold separating
     from them.

CHAPTER XXXII

SOME SIMPLE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

~Division of chemistry into organic and inorganic.~ Chemistry is usually divided into two great
divisions,--organic and inorganic. The original significance of these terms was entirely different
from the meaning which they have at the present time.

1. Original significance. The division into organic and inorganic was originally made because
it was believed that those substances which constitute the essential parts of living organisms
were built up under the influence of the life force of the organism. Such substances, therefore,
should be regarded as different from those compounds prepared in the laboratory or formed from
the inorganic or mineral constituents of the earth. In accordance with this view organic chemistry
included those substances formed by living organisms. Inorganic chemistry, on the other hand,
included all substances formed from the mineral portions of the earth.

In 1828 the German chemist Wöhler prepared urea, a typical organic compound, from inorganic
materials. The synthesis of other so-called organic compounds followed, and at present it is
known that the same chemical laws apply to all substances whether formed in the living organism
or prepared in the laboratory from inorganic constituents. The terms "organic" and "inorganic"
have therefore lost their original significance.

2. Present significance. The great majority of the compounds found in living organisms contain
carbon, and the term "organic chemistry," as used at present, includes not only these compounds
but all compounds of carbon. Organic chemistry has become, therefore, the chemistry of the
compounds of carbon, all other substances being treated under the head of inorganic chemistry.
This separation of the compounds of carbon into a group by themselves is made almost necessary
by their great number, over one hundred thousand having been recorded. For convenience some
of the simpler carbon compounds, such as the oxides and the carbonates, are usually discussed
in inorganic chemistry.

~The grouping of compounds in classes.~ The study of organic chemistry is much simplified by
the fact that the large number of bodies included in this field may be grouped in classes of
similar compounds. It thus becomes possible to study the properties of each class as a whole,
in much the same way as we study a group of elements. The most important of these classes are
the hydrocarbons, the alcohols, the aldehydes, the acids, the ethereal salts, the ethers, the
ketones, the organic bases, and the carbohydrates. A few members of each of these classes will
now be discussed briefly.

THE HYDROCARBONS

Carbon and hydrogen combine to form a large number of compounds. These compounds are known
collectively as the hydrocarbons. They may be divided into a number of groups or series, each
being named from its first member. Some of the groups are as follows:

    METHANE SERIES
    CH{4}      methane
    C{2}H{6}  ethane
    C{3}H{8}  propane
    C{4}H{10} butane
    C{5}H{12} pentane
    C{6}H{14} hexane
    C{7}H{16} heptane
    C{8}H{18} octane

    ETHYLENE SERIES
    C{2}H{4} ethylene
    C{3}H{6} propylene
    C{4}H{8} butylene

    BENZENE SERIES
    C{6}H{6}  benzene
    C{7}H{8}  toluene
    C{8}H{10} xylene

    ACETYLENE SERIES
    C{2}H{2} acetylene
    C{3}H{4} allylene

Only the lower members (that is, those which contain a small number of carbon atoms) of the
above groups are given. The methane series is the most extensive, all of the compounds up to
C{24}H{50} being known.

It will be noticed that the successive members of each of the above series differ by the group
of atoms (CH{2}). Such a series is called an homologous series. In general, it may be stated
that the members of an homologous series show a regular gradation in most physical properties
and are similar in chemical properties. Thus in the methane group the first four members are
gases at ordinary temperatures; those containing from five to sixteen carbon atoms are liquids,
the boiling points of which increase with the number of carbon atoms present. Those containing
more than sixteen carbon atoms are solids.

~Sources of the hydrocarbons.~ There are two chief sources of the hydrocarbons, namely, (1)
crude petroleum and (2) coal tar.

1. Crude petroleum. This is a liquid pumped from wells driven into the earth in certain localities.
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, California, and Texas are the chief oil-producing regions in the
United States. The crude petroleum consists largely of liquid hydrocarbons in which are dissolved
both gaseous and solid hydrocarbons. Before being used it must be refined. In this process
the petroleum is run into large iron stills and subjected to fractional distillation. The various
hydrocarbons distill over in the general order of their boiling points. The distillates which
collect between certain limits of temperature are kept separate and serve for different uses;
they are further purified, generally by washing with sulphuric acid, then with an alkali, and
finally with water. Among the products obtained from crude petroleum in this way are the naphthas,
including benzine and gasoline, kerosene or coal oil, lubricating oils, vaseline, and paraffin.
None of these products are definite chemical compounds, but each consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons,
the boiling points of which lie within certain limits.

2. Coal tar. This product is obtained in the manufacture of coal gas, as already explained.
It is a complex mixture and is refined by the same general method used in refining crude petroleum.
The principal hydrocarbons obtained from the coal tar are benzene, toluene, naphthalene, and
anthracene. In addition to the hydrocarbons, coal tar contains many other compounds, such as
carbolic acid and aniline.

~Properties of the hydrocarbons.~ The lower members of the first two series of hydrocarbons
mentioned are all gases; the succeeding members are liquids. In some series, as the methane
series, the higher members are solids. The preparation and properties of methane and acetylene
have been discussed in a previous chapter. Ethylene is present in small quantities in coal
gas and may be obtained in the laboratory by treating alcohol (C{2}H{6}O) with sulphuric acid:

    C{2}H{6}O = C{2}H{4} + H{2}O.

Benzene, the first member of the benzene series, is a liquid boiling at 80°.

The hydrocarbons serve as the materials from which a large number of compounds can be prepared;
indeed, it has been proposed to call organic chemistry the chemistry of the hydrocarbon derivatives.

~Substitution products of the hydrocarbons.~ As a rule, at least a part of the hydrogen in
any hydrocarbon can be displaced by an equivalent amount of certain elements or groups of elements.
Thus the compounds CH{3}Cl, CH{2}Cl{2}, CHCl{3}, CCl{4} can be obtained from methane by treatment
with chlorine. Such compounds are called substitution products.

~Chloroform~ (CHCl{3}). This can be made by treating methane with chlorine, as just indicated,
although a much easier method consists in treating alcohol or acetone (which see) with bleaching
powder. Chloroform is a heavy liquid having a pleasant odor and a sweetish taste. It is largely
used as a solvent and as an anæsthetic in surgery.

~Iodoform~ (CHI{3}). This is a yellow crystalline solid obtained by treating alcohol with iodine
and an alkali. It has a characteristic odor and is used as an antiseptic.

ALCOHOLS

When such a compound as CH{3}Cl is treated with silver hydroxide the reaction expressed by
the following equation takes place:

    CH{3}Cl + AgOH = CH{3}OH + AgCl.

Similarly C{2}H{5}Cl will give C{2}H{5}OH and AgCl. The compounds CH{3}OH and C{2}H{5}OH so
obtained belong to the class of substances known as alcohols. From their formulas it will be
seen that they may be regarded as derived from hydrocarbons by substituting the hydroxyl group
(OH) for hydrogen. Thus the alcohol CH{3}OH may be regarded as derived from methane (CH{4})
by substituting the group OH for one atom of hydrogen. A great many alcohols are known, and,
like the hydrocarbons, they may be grouped into series. The relation between the first three
members of the methane series and the corresponding alcohols is shown in the following table:

    CH{4}     (methane)       CH{3}OH       (methyl alcohol).
    C{2}H{6} (ethane)        C{2}H{5}OH   (ethyl alcohol).
    C{3}H{8} (propane)       C{3}H{7}OH   (propyl alcohol).
