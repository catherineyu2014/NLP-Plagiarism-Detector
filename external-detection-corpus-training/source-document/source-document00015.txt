     I tried Louisa W.'s recipe for Everton taffy, only I added half a
     tea-cupful of water. I like it very much.

     Here is a recipe for white candy: Two cups of white crushed sugar;
     three-quarters of a cup of water; one table-spoonful of cream of
     tartar. Boil quickly, trying a little in water occasionally until
     it crisps. Then add half a tea-spoonful of soda. Pour it in a
     buttered pan until it is cool enough to pull. I am ten years old.

     I love YOUNG PEOPLE very much. Soon as papa brings it home I read
     it to my two little sisters. We are very much interested in "The
     Moral Pirates." I am ten years old, and I go to school every day.
     Can any one tell me if the flamingo is of any use?

     Here is a recipe for the cooking club. Put a layer of the
     dark batter in the pan, then a layer of light, until the pan is
     full.

     I should like to exchange pressed flowers with any little girl in

Everything has its uses in the great economy of nature, and although we can not always see
why it is necessary for certain things to exist, we may be sure that they were all created
for some purpose. The flamingo, however, is useful as an article of food. In certain parts
of Egypt and the East roast flamingo is considered very delicate eating, and in ancient times
a stew of flamingo tongues was a royal dish. It is also a very beautiful bird. Travellers say
there is no sight more magnificent than a flock of scarlet flamingos wading in the green waving
water grasses, hunting for their breakfast in the morning sunlight. The flamingo, if it could
speak, might answer your question in the words of Mr. Emerson, the poet:

  "Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,
  Then beauty is its own excuse for being."

     I am nine years old, and I wish to send the cooking club a recipe
     for "one-two-three-four cake": One cup of butter; two cups of
     sugar; three cups of flour; four eggs; half a cup of milk; the
     grated rind of one lemon; a pinch of salt; one tea-spoonful of
     royal baking powder.

     I have taken YOUNG PEOPLE from the first number, and I think it is
     a very nice paper. I like to read about the pets of the other
     children, and I will tell them about a pet cat I had when we lived
     in Chicago. Her name was Daisy, and as she was black and white, we
     thought it a pretty name for her. My little brother Jack had a
     pair of bantam chickens. One day when Daisy was asleep in the yard
     the rooster flew on her back and picked her left eye out. Grandma,
     who was in the yard at the time, told the cook to bring Daisy in,
     while she went for her feather and goose-grease, and put some on
     the wounded eye. The next day it was healed, but the sight was
     gone. Once when Daisy had some little kittens she put them in a
     hen's nest. When the hen came into the nest she would keep the
     little things quiet by pecking them on the head if they cried. The
     kittens and chickens grew to be great friends. They would eat out
     of the same dish, and when night came they would all go to the
     chicken-coop together. The kittens slept in the nest, and the
     chickens on the roost. Were they not a happy family?

     I am very sorry I forgot the flour in my recipe for apple-cake in
     Post-office Box, No. 37. There should be enough prepared flour
     added to make a stiff batter. It is better to bake it in a shallow
     pan.

     I think "Across the Ocean" was a splendid story. I read it all.
     But now I like "The Moral Pirates'" the best.

     I have forty-six pet rabbits. They all have black eyes and black
     ears. And I have two kittens which are very pretty. Their names
     are Tiger and Malt.

     Lula Barlow can preserve eggs by piercing a small hole at each end
     of the egg, and blowing out the inside. Eggs can be sent safely by
     mail in a box filled with cotton.

     I would like to exchange postage stamps of different nations with
     any of those correspondents asking exchange, or with any other
     readers of YOUNG PEOPLE.

     I would like to exchange specimens of woods indigenous to this
     climate for those of other climates, specimens to be about three
     inches long by three-quarters of an inch thick, and to have a knot
     in them if possible. I have cypress, magnolia, mimosa, Cottonwood,
     althea, prickly ash, fig, crepe myrtle, sweet-gum, and black-gum.
     Correspondents willing to exchange will please send me a list of
     what woods they can obtain, and their full address.

     I have made the acquaintance of several boys who read YOUNG
     PEOPLE, through the Post-office Box, as I am collecting postage
     stamps. If others who have not yet written are doing the same, I
     would like to exchange with them. I wrote to Sidney St. W., but he
     has not yet answered me. I am eleven years old. My younger
     brother, Charlie, is collecting postmarks, and has already eleven
     hundred and seventy-five. He would like to exchange with any of
     the boys.

     home and pleasures. The name of my home is Baywood Lodge. It is
     within a stone's-throw of a beautiful sheet of water known as
     Hempstead Bay. We sail, row, swim, and fish, and we have horses,
     and enjoy riding horseback too.

     There is a camp very near us, in the woods. There are about thirty
     people, and they have five tents, and their horses.

     I would like to exchange foreign postage stamps with any boys who
     read YOUNG PEOPLE.

H. P. C.--The quail builds its nest on the ground, among bushes or tall grass. The nesting-time
is early in June, and when you find ten or more little white eggs, you may be sure the bird
has commenced setting. The eggs are about the size of a pigeon's egg, and pointed at one end
like a boy's wooden top. When the little birds are hatched they are as strong as little chickens,
and the mother bird takes them off to ramble about the thicket in the same way as a hen leads
her brood. The quail is a plump grayish-brown bird, speckled with black and white. Its peculiar
whistle may be heard anywhere in the country all the long summer day. Children often imitate
the sound, and imagine that the quail is always screaming "more wet"; and in truth the quail's
note does resemble those words, with a short, quick accent on the last sound, as if the bird
was constantly entreating nature for a refreshing summer shower.
