CONSTITUTION.

ART. I. This society shall be called the American Missionary Association.

ART. II. The object of this Association shall be to conduct Christian missionary and educational
operations and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own country and other countries
which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent fields of effort.

ART. III. Members of evangelical churches may be constituted members of this Association for
life by the payment of thirty dollars into its treasury, with the written declaration at the
time or times of payment that the sum is to be applied to constitute a designated person a
life member; and such membership shall begin sixty days after the payment shall have been completed.
Other persons, by the payment of the same sum, may be made life members without the privilege
of voting.

Every evangelical church which has within a year contributed to the funds of the Association
and every State Conference or Association of such churches may appoint two delegates to the
Annual Meeting of the Association; such delegates, duly attested by credentials, shall be members
of the Association for the year for which they were thus appointed.

ART. IV. The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be held in the month of October or November,
at such time and place as may be designated by the Association, or, in case of its failure
to act, by the Executive Committee, by notice printed in the official publication of the Association
for the preceding month.

ART. V. The officers of the Association shall be a President, five Vice-Presidents, a Corresponding
Secretary or Secretaries, a Recording Secretary, a Treasurer, Auditors, and an Executive Committee
of fifteen members, all of whom shall be elected by ballot.

At the first Annual Meeting after the adoption of this Constitution, five members of the Executive
Committee shall be elected for the term of one year, five for two years and five for three
years, and at each subsequent Annual Meeting, five members shall be elected for the full term
of three years, and such others as shall be required to fill vacancies.

ART. VI. To the Executive Committee shall belong the collecting and disbursing of funds, the
appointing, counseling, sustaining and dismissing of missionaries and agents, and the selection
of missionary fields. They shall have authority to fill all vacancies in office occurring between
the Annual Meetings; to apply to any Legislature for acts of incorporation, or conferring corporate
powers; to make provision when necessary for disabled missionaries and for the widows and children
of deceased missionaries, and in general to transact all such business as usually appertains
to the Executive Committees of missionary and other benevolent societies. The acts of the Committee
shall be subject to the revision of the Annual Meeting.

Five members of the Committee constitute a quorum for transacting business.

ART. VII. No person shall be made an officer of this Association who is not a member of some
evangelical church.

ART. VIII. Missionary bodies and churches or individuals may appoint and sustain missionaries
of their own, through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.

ART. IX. No amendment shall be made to this Constitution except by the vote of two-thirds of
the members present at an Annual Meeting and voting, the amendment having been approved by
the vote of a majority at the previous Annual Meeting.
