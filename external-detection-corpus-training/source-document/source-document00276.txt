SCULPTURE.

CHAPTER I.

ANCIENT SCULPTURE.

EGYPT.

No one can speak with exactness as to the time when sculpture was first practised by the Egyptians;
we only know that it was a very long time ago. But we do know that in the time of the twelfth
dynasty, which dates from 2466 B.C., sculpture had reached a stage of excellence such as could
only have resulted from the experience of many years of training and practice in this art.

In the Egyptian collection of the Louvre, at Paris, there is the memorial stone of an old Egyptian
sculptor which has an inscription that reads as if he had written it himself; this was the
way by which Egyptians made these inscriptions sound as if the dead themselves spoke to those
who were still alive. This sculptor's name was Martisen, and he lived about forty-four centuries
ago. Brugsch-Bey, a very learned writer on Egypt, says: "He calls himself 'a master among those
who understand art, and a plastic artist,' who 'was a wise artist in his art.' He relates in
succession his knowledge in the making of statues, in every position, according to prescribed
use and measure; and brings forward, as his particular invention, an etching with colors, if
I have rightly understood the expression, 'which can neither be injured by fire nor washed
off by water; 'and, as a further explanation of this, states that 'no man has arisen who has
been able to do this except himself alone and the eldest son of his race, whom God's will has
created. He has arisen able to do this, and the exercise of his hand has been admired in masterly
works in all sorts of precious stones, from gold and silver to ivory and ebony.'"

There is no doubt but that Martisen and his son, who was named Usurtasen, were sculptors at
the time when Egyptian art reached its highest point.

The earliest works of Egyptian sculpture are the bas-reliefs found in the chambers of the tombs;
the walls are almost covered with them, and they are painted with colors which are still bright
and fresh, though more than four thousand years have passed since they were put on. The subjects
of these reliefs are taken from the life of the persons buried in the tombs, and even their
possessions and occupations are thus represented. These sculptures were made by tracing the
designs on the stone and then cutting it away between the figures. The mode of arrangement
in these reliefs does not satisfy our ideas of what it should be. It seems as if the artists
had no plan of their work in their minds--no aim as to what the effect should be when finished.
On the contrary, the reliefs impress us as if the sculptors made one figure, and then added
another and another in such a way as to represent the fact they wished to tell without any
attention to the beauty of the whole; and so it does not seem as if there was any unity in
them, but as if the large bas-reliefs were made up of disjointed parts which in one sense really
have no relation to each other.

The same is true of the Egyptian statues. It appears as if the different parts might have been
made separately or even by different sculptors, and then joined together. All this is because
the Egyptians seemed to think of an object in parts and not as a whole. Then, too, the position
of the early statues was so unnatural and awkward. The arms were placed close to the sides
of the body, and there was no separation between the legs; and though in some of their articles
of furniture, their pottery, and in the details of their architecture, the Egyptians made a
great advance, they did not equally improve in their sculpture.

One great hindrance to the progress of Egyptian sculpture was the fact that figures were never
represented in action. They were not figures moving and living in stone; they were like figures
petrified and fixed: they were statues, and no one can forget this for a moment while looking
at them. I can learn of but one Egyptian figure sculptured as if in action; this is a quoit-thrower
in the Tombs of the Kings. A sitting statue, whether of a man or a woman, had the hands rested
on the knees or held across the breast (Fig. 1).

There were very few groups in Egyptian sculpture, and these seldom had more than two figures.
It was customary to represent a husband and wife sitting on the same chair holding each other's
hands, or having their arms around one another's waists or shoulders. Sometimes the principal
figure is of large size, and the inferior persons are made much smaller and placed at the sides
of the larger figure. In short, very few attitudes are represented in Egyptian sculpture, and
it almost seems as if there must have been fixed rules for a certain limited number of positions
after which all sculptured figures were made.

In spite of this sameness and stiffness, Egyptian sculpture is remarkable, and it is probable
that if they had not been fettered by prejudices and rules the Egyptians would have excelled
both in sculpture and painting.

The sides of obelisks and, more especially, the walls of temples were covered with sculptures
which gave the history of kings--of their wars and conquests, and of their great works in their
kingdoms. The sculptures upon the temple walls could be estimated by square rods, or even acres,
better than by lesser measures. Their amount and the labor it required to make them are simply
marvellous.

I will describe the subjects depicted upon one inner wall in the palace-temple of Medemet Haboo,
and will quote from Wilkinson's "Egypt and Thebes." On the west wall "the Egyptian princes
and generals conduct the 'captive chiefs' into the presence of the king. He is seated at the
back of his car, and the spirited horses are held by his attendants on foot. Large heaps of
hands are placed before him, which an officer counts, one by one, as the other notes down their
number on a scroll; each heap containing three thousand, and the total indicating the returns
of the enemy's slain. The number of captives, reckoned one thousand in each line, is also mentioned
in the hieroglyphics above, where the name of the Rebo points out the nation against whom this
war was carried on. Their flowing dresses, striped horizontally with blue or green bands on
a white ground, and their long hair and aquiline noses give them the character of an Eastern
nation in the vicinity of Assyria and Persia, as their name reminds us of the Rhibii of Ptolemy,
whom he places near the Caspian." ...

The suite of this historical subject continues on the south wall. The king, returning victorious
to Egypt, proceeds slowly in his car, conducting in triumph the prisoners he has made, who
walk beside and before it, three others being bound to the axle. Two of his sons attend as
fan-bearers, and the several regiments of Egyptian infantry, with a corps of their allies,
under the command of these princes, marching in regular step and in the close array of disciplined
troops, accompany their king. He arrives at Thebes, and presents his captives to Amen-Ra and
Mut, the deities of the city, who compliment him, as usual, on the victory he has gained, and
the overthrow of the enemy he has "trampled beneath his feet."

This description of these bas-reliefs, which are usually painted, will give an idea of the
great works of Egyptian sculptors.

The representation of the animals in these sculptures is as successful as any part of them.
There being no intellectual expression required, they are more pleasing than the human beings,
with their set, unchanging features and expression. The Egyptians had several breeds of dogs,
and the picture here (Fig. 2) is made up from the dogs found in the sculptures--No. 1, hound;
2, mastiff; 3, turnspit; 4, 5, fox-dogs; 6, 7, greyhounds.

One of the figures often repeated by the sculptors of Egypt was the Sphinx. The colossal and
most famous one (Fig. 5) is not far from the great pyramid, and has the form of a recumbent
lion with a human head. It is one hundred and seventy-two feet long, and is the Sphinx of the
world; but there were great numbers of these strange figures in Egypt--in some cases there
were avenues leading to the temples bordered by them on each side. The form of the Sphinx was
intended to express some spiritual thought to the Egyptians, and the stories about it are very
interesting. Its form certainly denotes the union of physical and mental power. The form of
which we have spoken as being that of the great Sphinx is called the androsphinx (Fig. 3).
Another has the body of the lion with the head of the ram, and is called the kriosphinx (Fig.
4); still another has the same body and the head of a hawk; this is called the hieracosphinx
(Fig. 6). They all typified the king, without doubt, and it is probable that the various heads
were so given to show respect for the different gods who were represented with the heads of
these creatures. Sometimes the androsphinx has human hands in place of the lion's paws. The
winged Sphinx has been found in Egypt, but it is rare.

The colossal statues of Egypt are very wonderful on account of their vast weight and size.
The most famous are two which stand on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes (Fig. 7). Each of
these colossi is made from a single block of stone such as is not found within several days'
journey of the place where they stand. They are forty-seven feet high, and contain eleven thousand
five hundred cubic feet each. But a third is still larger; it represents the King Rameses II.,
and, when whole, was of a single stone, and weighed eight hundred and eighty-seven tons. It
was brought from Assouan to Thebes, a distance of one hundred and thirty-eight miles. It is
wonderful to think of moving such a vast weight over such a distance, and one would naturally
wish to know also how the sculptors could work on such a statue. The plate here given (Fig.
8) shows the process of polishing a statue, and the following one (Fig. 9) illustrates the
mode of moving one when finished. These representations are found in tombs and grottoes, and
tell us plainly just what we wish to know about these things.

I have now pointed out the marked peculiarities of Egyptian sculpture, and before leaving the
subject will call your attention to the fact that in most cases it was used in connection with
and almost as a part of Egyptian architecture. In the tombs the bas-reliefs are for the decoration
of the walls and to finish the work of the architect, while at the same time they are an interesting
feature of the art of the nation and period. In the temple palaces this is also true--though
the reliefs serve the purpose of telling the history of the kings; they are, as it were, framed
into and make a part of the architectural effect. The obelisks, colossal figures and Sphinxes
were placed before the grand buildings, and made a part of them architecturally. In general
terms we may say that sculpture never became an independent art in Egypt, but was essentially
wedded to architecture; and this fact largely accounts for that other truth that sculpture
never reached the perfection in Egypt that it promised, or the excellence that would have seemed
to be the natural result of its earliest attainments.

ASSYRIA.

The works of sculpture in Assyria consisted of statues, bas-reliefs, statuettes in clay, carvings
in ivory, metal castings, and some smaller works, such as articles for jewelry, made in minute
imitation of larger works in sculpture.

The statues found in Assyria are by no means beautiful, according to our idea of beauty. They
are as set and stiff in design as the Egyptian works of this sort, and they have suffered so
much injury from the weather and from violence that we cannot judge of the manner in which
they were originally finished.

The number of Assyrian statues that have been found is small; this one given here (Fig. 10),
of Sardanapalus I., is in the best state of preservation of any of them. It is smaller than
life size, being about forty-two inches high. The statuettes of the Assyrians are less artistic
than the statues. They are made from a clay which turned red in baking, and are colored so
as to resemble Greek pottery. They are almost always of a grotesque appearance, and usually
represent gods or genii. They also combine human and animal forms in a less noble and artistic
way than is done in the Egyptian representation of the Sphinx. There are also small figures
of animals in terra-cotta, principally dogs and ducks. But the large and small statues of the
Assyrians are their most unimportant works in sculpture. It is in their bas-reliefs that their
greatest excellence is seen, and in them alone their progress in art can be traced. This sort
of sculpture seems to have been used by the Assyrians just as painting was used in Italy after
the Renaissance. It was their mode of expressing everything. Through it they gave expression
to their religious feeling; they told the history of their nation, and glorified their kings;
they represented the domestic scenes which now make the subjects of genre pictures; and even
imitated vegetables and fruits, as well as to reproduce landscapes and architecture in these
pictures cut from stone. In truth, it is chiefly from the bas-reliefs that we learn the history
of Assyria, and in this view their sculptures are even more important than when they are considered
merely from an artistic view.

The most ancient palaces at Nimrud furnish the earliest examples of bas-relief. These date
at about the end of the tenth century B.C. One striking peculiarity in the design is that all
the figures, both men and animals, are given in exact profile. In spite of this sameness of
position they have much spirit and action. The picture of a lion-hunt given here (Fig. 11)
is one of the very best of these reliefs, and you will notice that the animal forms are much
superior to those of the human beings. This is true of all Assyrian art in all its stages.
In these oldest bas-reliefs there are no backgrounds; but later on these are added, and mountains,
hills, streams, trees, and wild animals are all introduced as details of the general design.
The highest state of this art was reached about 650 B.C. At this period the various forms seem
to be more varied and less arranged according to some rule. The human faces and figures are
more delicately finished, and there is an air of freedom and a spirit in the handling of the
subjects that is far better than that of any other time. The plants and trees are far more
beautiful than before.

The figures of animals, too, are full of life and action in this period. I shall only give
one illustration, and shall choose the head of a lion, probably the best specimen of animal
drawing which is yet known in Assyrian art. It represents the head of a wounded lion, who,
in his agony, rushes upon a chariot and seizes the wheel with his teeth. The drawing of this
head, as a portrayal of agony and fierceness, compares favorably with anything of the same
kind belonging to any age of art, either classic or modern (Fig. 12).

There is a question which has not yet been decided as to the amount of color used on the Assyrian
bas-reliefs. From the traces of color remaining on those that are found in the excavations,
and from what we know of the use of colors on the buildings to which the bas-reliefs belonged,
we may be sure that colors were used on them; but to what extent cannot be told. It may have
been applied with the freedom of the Egyptians, or it may have been sparingly used, as was
the manner of the ancient Greeks. The colors that have been found in the ruins of Assyria are
white, black, red and blue.

Next to the sculpture, the metal work of the Assyrians was the most important of their arts.
This work was done in three ways: I. Whole figures or parts of figures cast in a solid shape.
II. Castings of low bas-reliefs. III. Embossed designs made chiefly with the hammer, but finished
with the graver. In the solid castings there are only animal forms, and lions are far more
numerous than any other creature. Many of them have a ring fastened to the back, which indicates
that they were used for weights. These castings are all small and their form good; but we have
no reason to think that the Assyrians could make large metal castings.

The castings in relief were used to ornament thrones, furniture, and perhaps chariots. They
were fastened in their places by means of small nails. They had no great merit. The embossed
or hammered work, on the contrary, is artistic and very curious. Large numbers of embossed
bowls and dishes have been found, and this work was used for the end of sword-sheaths, the
sides of chairs and stools, and various other ornamental purposes. It is probable that the
main part of the tables, chairs, and so on were of wood, with the ornaments in embossed metals.
All this shows the Assyrians to have been an artistic people, and to have reached an interesting
stage in their arts, though their works are coarse and imperfect when judged by Greek standards
or by our own idea of what is beautiful. If we had the space to consider all the various designs
of the bas-reliefs in detail, you would learn from them a great many interesting facts concerning
the domestic life of this ancient and interesting people. From them we can learn all about
the costumes worn by the king and those of lesser rank; can see how their wars were carried
on, and what their chariots, weapons, and equipments were. Their games, amusements, musical
instruments, agricultural pursuits, food, and, in short, everything connected with their daily
life is plainly shown in these sculptures, and, as I have said before, the whole history of
Assyria is better studied from them than from any other one source. For this reason their great
value cannot be over-estimated (Fig. 13).

Other very ancient nations had sculptors, and a few remains of their arts still exist. This
is true of the Medes, Babylonians, and Persians; but the general features of their arts resembled
those of the Assyrians, though they were less advanced than that nation, and have left nothing
as interesting as the Egyptian and Assyrian remains which we have considered. I shall therefore
leave them and pass to the sculpture of Greece.

CHAPTER II.

GREEK SCULPTURE.

We have seen that the Egyptians and Assyrians were skilful in sculpture, but at the same time
their works have not moved us as we wish to be moved by art; there is always something beyond
them to be desired, and it remained for the Greeks to attain to that perfection in sculpture
which satisfies all our nature and fills our highest conceptions of beauty and grace. In truth,
in Greece alone has this perfection in plastic art existed, and since the time of its highest
excellence there no other nation has equalled the examples of Greek sculpture which still exist,
though we have reason to believe that its finest works have perished, and that those remaining
are of the second grade.

There are many reasons for the high artistic attainments of the Greeks, and a discussion or
even a simple statement of them would require an essay far too learned and lengthy for the
scope of this book; but I will speak of one truth that had great influence and went far to
perfect Greek art--that is, the unbounded love of beauty, which was an essential part of the
Greek nature. To the Greek, in fact, beauty and good had the same meaning--beauty was good,
and the good must be beautiful.

Sculpture deals almost exclusively with the form of man, and the other features in it have
some relation to the human element of the design; and it would have been impossible for a true
Greek to represent the human form otherwise than beautiful. A writer on this point says: "The
chief aim of the enlightened Greek, his highest ambition and his greatest joy, was to be a
man in the fullest sense of the word--man in the most complete development of his bodily strength
and beauty, in the active exercise of the keenest senses, in the greatest because tempered
enjoyment of sensual pleasure, in the free and joyous play of an intellect strong by nature,
graced and guided by the most exquisite taste, and enlightened by the sublimest philosophy."
Thus, beauty was so important to the Greek that every parent prayed that his children might
have this gift, and the names of beautiful persons were engraved upon pillars set where all
could read them; and at times there were competitions for the prize of beauty.

The religion of the Greek, too, taught that the body was the beautiful and godlike temple of
his soul; and the truth that human beings have something in common with a higher power than
their own gave him a great respect for humanity, and, in truth, he felt that if he could escape
death he should be content and almost, if not quite, a god. For we must remember that the gods
of the Greek were not all-wise, all-powerful, and all-good, as we believe our God to be. If
you read their mythology you will find that with the power of the god much imperfection and
weakness were mingled. They did not believe that Zeus had been the greatest god from the beginning,
but that there was a time when he had no power. He was not omniscient nor omnipresent, and
was himself subject to the decrees of Fate, as when he could not save his loved Sarpedon from
death. Not knowing all things, even the gods are sometimes represented as depending upon mortals
for information, and all these religious views tended to make the human form far more noble
to the Greek than it can be to the Christian, with his different views of the relations of
God and man.

Greek sculpture existed in very early days, and we have vague accounts of a person called DÆDALUS,
who seems to have been a wood-carver. Many cities claimed to have been his birthplace, and
no one can give any clear account of this ancient artist. He is called the inventor of the
axe, saw, gimlet, plummet-line, and a kind of fish-glue or isinglass. He is also said to have
been the first sculptor who separated the arms from the bodies of his statues, or made the
feet to step out; he also opened their eyes, and there is a legend that the statues of Dædalus
were so full of life that they were chained lest they should run away.

We call the time to which Dædalus belonged the prehistoric period, and his works and those
of other artists of his day have all perished. Two very ancient specimens of sculpture remain--the
Lion Gate of Mycenæ and the Niobe of Mount Sipylus; but as their origin is not known, and they
may not be the work of Greek artists, it is best for us to pass on to about 700 B.C., when
the records of individual artists begin.

Among the earliest of these was DIBUTADES, of whom Pliny said that he was the first who made
likenesses in clay. This author also adds that Dibutades first mixed red earth with clay, and
made the masks which were fastened to the end of the lowest hollow tiles on the roofs of temples.
Pliny relates the following story of the making of the first portrait in bas-relief.

Dibutades lived in Sicyon, and had a daughter called sometimes Kora, and again Callirhoe. She
could not aid her father very much in his work as a sculptor, but she went each day to the
flower-market and brought home flowers, which gave a very gay and cheerful air to her father's
little shop. Kora was very beautiful, and many young Greeks visited her father for the sake
of seeing the daughter. At length one of these youths asked Dibutades to take him as an apprentice;
and when this request was granted the young man made one of the family of the sculptor. Their
life was one of simple content. The young man could play upon the reed, and his education fitted
him to be the instructor of Kora. After a time, for some reason that Pliny does not mention,
it was best for the youth to go away from the artist's home, and he then asked Kora if she
would be his wife. She consented, and vows of betrothal were exchanged, while they were sad
at the thought of parting.

The last evening of his stay, as they sat together, Kora seized a coal from the brazier, and
traced upon the wall the outline of the face that was so dear to her; and she did this so correctly
that when her father saw it he knew instantly from what face it had been drawn. Then he wished
to do his part, for he also loved the young man. So he brought his clay and filled in the outline
which Kora had drawn, and so went on to model the first portrait in bas-relief that was ever
made. Thus did this great art grow out of the love of this beautiful maiden of Sicyon, about
twenty-five hundred years ago.
