  PEARL CREEK, NEW YORK.

     I thought I would write to you. My brother has a snapping-turtle,
     and a white rabbit with brownish spots on it, and my brother and I
     have three kittens. I like YOUNG PEOPLE very much, and I like the
     story of "The Moral Pirates."

     I am five years old. I can not read yet, but I get my sister to
     read the stories in YOUNG PEOPLE. I like them better than any I
     ever heard. My letter is getting 'most too long.

     A short time ago, fresh from the country, I was walking along
     Cortlandt Street, New York city, when I dimly heard the familiar
     "Bob White" whistled. "Papa, there's a quail," I exclaimed.
     "Nonsense," replied papa, laughing; "your imagination is lively."
     "But," I answered, "I really heard one." "They don't have quails
     in the city," said papa; "perhaps some boy or man is imitating the
     bird." I said no more until right at our elbow the shrill notes
     "Bob White" startled us both. Papa stopped, exclaiming, "That is a
     quail, surely." We looked about us, but could see no cage. "That
     is strange," said papa. Then we looked closer, and saw in a wire
     inclosure, extended from a cellar window to the sidewalk, an
     unused basin of an old fountain, filled with plants, while half
     concealed beneath the foliage were two plump birds, one of which
     extended his little head and saluted us with familiar notes again.
     A little crowd soon gathered, and listened with pleasure to the
     sweet notes of these feathered beauties, which here in the very
     centre of the business activities and bustle of the metropolis
     recalled recollections of woods and rural delights.

     I am a lame boy. I have hip-disease. One limb is shorter than the
     other, and I use crutches or a cane. I mean to be a doctor, and
     make hip-disease a specialty. Grandpa has promised me a nice
     carriage and harness, and my uncle says he will give me a nice
     horse when I grow up and get to be a doctor. I am eleven years old
     now. I must tell you how much I like YOUNG PEOPLE, especially the
     beautiful pictures.

     I like YOUNG PEOPLE very much. I have a great many dolls, and I
     feel very sorry for poor Jane, who fell in the water, but more
     sorry for her dear mamma, Fanny. I am glad that Dora and Bessie
     rescued Jane. I should like to know whether they ever found her
     curls when the tide went down.

     I like YOUNG PEOPLE better than any other paper we take. I am
     twelve years old. I have been to school three terms without being
     absent or tardy once. I would like to be a school-teacher when I
     am old enough.

     I tried Edith L.'s recipe for cream-candy, and I thought it very
     nice.

     There are a great many wild flowers here, both in the woods and on
     the prairies.

     My brothers have been busy harvesting, but they always find time
     to read YOUNG PEOPLE.
