PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOL. 152

JANUARY 10, 1917

CHARIVARIA.

The effect of the curtailed train-service throughout the country is already observable. On
certain sections of one of our Southern lines there are no trains running except those which
started prior to January 1st.

       ***

The new Treasury Notes, we are told, are to have a picture of the House of Commons on the back.
It is hoped that other places of amusement, such as the Crystal Palace and the Imperial Institute,
will be represented on subsequent issues.

       ***

It is announced from Germany that arrangements have been made whereby criminals are to be enrolled
in the army. They have, of course, already conducted many of its operations.

       ***

According to The Daily Chronicle there are only twenty-three full Generals in the British Army--a
total identical with that of the late Cabinet. It is only fair to the army to state that the
number is purely a coincidence.

       ***

  "THE RISE IN BOOT PRICES
  WOMEN'S LARGE PURCHASES."

The above headlines in a contemporary have caused a good deal of natural jealousy among members
of the Force.

       ***

"At them and through them!" says the Hamburger Fremdenblatt in a seasonable message to the
commander of the Turkish Navy. This will not deceive the Turk, who is beginning to realise
that, while the invitation to go at the enemy is sincere, any opportunities of "going through"
him will be exclusively grasped by his Teutonic ally.

       ***

Prince BUELOW has again arrived in Switzerland. It is these bold and dramatic strokes that
lift the German diplomat above the ranks of the commonplace.

       ***

It is explained by a railway official that a passenger who pays threepence for a ticket to-day
is really only giving the company twopence, the rest being water, owing to the decline in the
purchasing power of money. A movement is now on foot among some of the regular passengers to
endeavour to persuade the companies to consent to take their fares neat for the future.

       ***

At his Coronation the Emperor KARL OF AUSTRIA waved the sword of ST. STEPHEN towards the four
corners of the earth, to indicate his intention to protect his empire against all its foes.
The incident has been receiving the earnest consideration of the KAISER, who has now finally
decided that in the circumstances it is not necessary to regard it as an unfriendly act.

       ***

It was felt that the ceremonies connected with the Coronation ought to be curtailed out of
regard for the sufferings due to the War. So they dispensed with the customary distribution
of bread to the poor.

       ***

Lecturing to a juvenile audience Professor ARTHUR KEITH said that there was no difference between
detectives and scientists, and some of the older boys are still wondering whether he was trying
to popularise science or to discredit detective stories.

       ***

Germans cannot now obtain footwear, it is reported, without a permit card. Nevertheless we
know a number of them who are assured of getting the boot without any troublesome formalities.

       ***

Burglars have stolen eighteen ducks from the estate of BETHMANN-HOLLWEG. It will be interesting
to note how their defence--that "Necessity knows no law"--is received by the distinguished
advocate of the invasion of Belgium.

       ***

"Taxicab drivers must expect a very low standard of intoxication to apply to them," said the
Lambeth magistrate last week. On the other hand the police should be careful not to misinterpret
the air of light-hearted devilry that endeared the "growler" to the hearts of an older generation.

       ***

It is stated that £2,250,000 has been sent by Germany into Switzerland to raise the exchanges.
A much larger sum, according to Mr. PUTNAM, was sent into the United States merely to raise
the wind.

       ***

Referring to the Highland regiments a Globe writer says, "The streets of London will reel with
the music of the pipes when they come back." This is one of those obstacles to peace that has
been overlooked by the KAISER.

VIENNA-BOUND: A REVERIE EN ROUTE.

[A Wireless Press telegram says: "The German Imperial train has reached Constantinople in order
to transport the Sultan to Vienna, to take part in the conference of Sovereigns to be held there."]

  I hate all trains and told them so;
    I said that I should much prefer
    (Being, as Allah knows, no traveller)
  To stick to Stamboul and the status quo.

  They said, "If you would rather walk,
    Pray do so; it will save the fare;"
    Which shows that WILLIAM (who will take the Chair)
  Insists that I shall come and hear him talk.

  I've never tried a train before;
    It makes me sick; it knocks my nerves;
    The noises and the tunnels and the curves
  Add a new horror to the woes of war.

  What am I here for, anyhow?
    I'm summoned for appearance' sake,
    To nod approval at the Chief, but take
  No further part in his one-man pow-wow.

  My job is just to sit, it seems,
    And act the silent super's rôle,
    The while I wish myself, with all my soul,
  Safe back in one or more of my hareems.

  I'd let the Conference go hang;
    Any who likes can have my pew
    And play at peace-talk with this pirate crew,
  WILLIAM and KARL and FERDIE--what a gang!

  Our Chairman wants to save his skin
    And (curse this train!) to cook a plan
    For Germany to pouch what spoils she can--
  All very nice; but where do I come in?

  At best I'm but the missing link
    Upon his Berlin-Baghdad line;
    This is the senior partner's show, not mine;
  Will he consult my feelings? I don't think.

  If Russia's gain should mean my loss,
    He'll wince at Teuton schemes cut short,
    But for my grief, expelled from my own Porte,
  Will he care greatly? Not one little toss.

  Well, as I've said and said again,
    'Tis Fate (Kismet), and, should it frown,
    We Faithful have to take it lying down--
  And yet, by Allah, how I loathe this train!

O. S.

    "A subaltern friend of mine landed at Gibraltar for a few hours, and he
    was anxious to be able to say that he had been to Spain. So he walked
    along the Isthmus to Ceuta, where the British and Spanish sentries
    faced one another, and directly the Spanish soldier turned his head he
    hopped quickly over into Spain. Then the sentry turned round, and he
    hopped back again even more quickly."--Daily Sketch.

Those of our readers who have walked from the Gibraltar frontier to Morocco and back, like
the above subaltern, know that it takes some doing.

    "JAMES PHILLIPS, 16, was charged with doing damage to the extent of £4
    10s. at a refreshment shop in Hackney belonging to Peter Persico. As he
    was kept waiting a little time he broke a plate on the table; then he
    put a saucer under his heel and broke it. When remonstrated with he
    broke 10 cups and saucers by throwing them at partitions and enamelled
    decorations, and overturned a marble table, the top of which he
    smashed."--The Times.

No doubt he was incited to these naughty deeds by the line, very popular in Hackney circles,
"Persico's odi, puer, apparatus."

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.

(The Emperor of AUSTRIA and Count TISZA.)

Tisza. So there is the full account, your Majesty, of men killed, wounded and captured.

The Emperor. It is a gloomy list and I hardly can bear to consider it.
