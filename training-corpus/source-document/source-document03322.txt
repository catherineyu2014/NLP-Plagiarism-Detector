     I am very much interested in the Wiggles, and I read all the
     poetry in YOUNG PEOPLE. I like the Letter-box better than
     anything. I get my paper from the bookstore here. I wish you would
     tell me where I can buy a cannon, a real cannon, so I can shoot on
     the Fourth of July.

     I am twelve years old. I have a little dog and a big cat. They
     play together all the time. Sometimes when they are playing they
     get so tired that they lie down together and go to sleep. My
     sister had a wax doll. One day she left it on the table, and my
     dog got it, and tore off all its hair.

     We have three cats. One is black and white, and it jumps into
     mamma's lap every time it comes into the room. And we have a dear
     little colt one month old. When the man puts it in the field it
     races all around, and seems to enjoy itself so much. I am nearly
     ten years old.

     In YOUNG PEOPLE No. 32 a little girl asks for a recipe for bread.
     Here is one: For a small baking of bread take one medium-sized
     potato, boil it, and mash it fine; add a heaping table-spoonful of
     flour, and pour over it a tea-cupful of boiling water; let it
     stand until it is lukewarm, then stir in two table-spoonfuls of
     yeast--my mamma uses home-made--and set it in a warm place (not
     too warm) to rise. When it comes up light, add a cup of lukewarm
     water, a tea-spoonful of salt, and flour enough to make a batter.
     Let this rise, and then mix in flour until it is stiff: your mamma
     will tell you when it is right. You must let this rise again, and
     then make it into loaves, using as little dry flour as possible in
     this last process. If you wish to make biscuit, a little butter or
     lard improves it After the mixture is in the pan, you must let it
     rise again before putting it into the oven.

     I was ten years old last Decoration-day. I have never made any
     bread yet, but mamma is going to let me try soon.

     I tried Nellie H.'s recipe for candy, and I think it is real nice.
     We have a large Newfoundland dog. He will carry a basket, and will
     catch a ball, and he will give you his paw. His name is Spot.

     I will exchange pressed ferns with Emma Foltz in the fall.

     I am making a collection of bugs, and would like to exchange with
     little boys and girls in the West who take YOUNG PEOPLE. I have
     only collected a few bugs yet.

     Here is a recipe for very nice Graham bread for Puss Hunter. I
     make it very often for my papa, and he likes it better than any
     other bread. I am fourteen years old. Take one quart of lukewarm
     water, half a coffee-cup of yeast, two table-spoonfuls of lard,
     two table-spoonfuls of white sugar, one tea-spoonful of salt, one
     tea-spoonful of soda; melt the sugar and lard in the warm water;
     stir in very smoothly three pints of flour; then pour in the yeast
     and the soda. Beat it hard for a few minutes, and then put it in a
     warm place to rise. This is the sponge, and will take about eight
     hours, or all day, to rise. Then at night add two quarts of Graham
     meal and one cup of sugar, and, if it is too stiff, a little more
     warm water. Let this mixture rise overnight. In the morning stir
     it down with a spoon to get the air out, and put it in the pans.
     I let it rise in the pans about two hours before I put it in the
     oven. This recipe will make two good-sized loaves. Do all the
     mixing with a spoon, as it makes it sticky if you touch your hands
     to it. I wish Puss Hunter, if she tries it, would tell me if she
     has success.

     I am eleven years old. I like YOUNG PEOPLE very much. I have a
     flower garden of my own, and two pets--a canary named Phil, and a
     cat. My bird will not sing. Can any correspondent tell me what to
     do for it? My papa has a pet crow. It is very funny.

     I would like to exchange pressed flowers with any little girl in
     the West.

     I have been taking YOUNG PEOPLE from the first number, and I like
     it ever so much.

     I have a little brother named Charlie, and he is a great favorite
     with everybody. He is very sharp for a little boy three years old.
     Last year we spent the summer in Cincinnati, and mamma took
     Charlie to the circus. When the procession came out he said, "Oh,
     mamma, look at the elephant, and the camel behind him!" Mamma
     thought he did not know what a camel was, so when they came around
     again mamma said, "There is the elephant, Charlie; and what is
     behind him now?" Charlie did not answer, so mamma asked him again.
     Then he looked up at her, and said, in a very droll tone, "His
     tail."

     I am collecting stamps, and would gladly exchange with any readers
     of YOUNG PEOPLE. I am twelve years old.

     If any birds' egg collector of California or the Western States
     will exchange eggs with me, I will be much pleased. I will send
     one dozen different kinds for as many of his. They are as follows:
     Chaffinch, quail, kingbird, crested jay, brown thrush,
     mocking-bird, sparrow, cat-bird, bluebird, peewee, swamp
     blackbird, wren. I will be obliged if any boy will send me his
     address, and a list of the varieties he is willing to exchange for
     mine.

WILLIE ATKINSON.--There are about 225 islands in the Feejee group, of which 140 are inhabited.
Viti Levu is the largest and most populous, being 97 miles from east to west, and 64 from north
to south. Next to this is Vanua Levu, which is 115 miles long, and about 25 miles wide. The
whole group contains, exclusive of coral islets, an area of about 5500 square miles of dry land.

means of the exchanges offered by our young correspondents.

LILY B., MABEL C. L., AND OTHERS.--Your puzzles are very skillfully made, but are rendered
unavailable by their solutions, which are precisely the same as those of puzzles published
in former numbers of the YOUNG PEOPLE. Correspondents by taking special notice of the fact,
which we have already stated, that we can not repeat solutions, will save themselves from many
disappointments.
