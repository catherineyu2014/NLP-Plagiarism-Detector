The King commanded that they should bring splendid presents for the hero. The presents were
these: A throne of turquoise, adorned with rams' heads; a royal crown set about with jewels;
a robe of brocade of gold, such as is worn by the King of kings; a bracelet and a chain of
gold; a hundred maidens, with faces fair as the full moon, and girdles of gold; a hundred youths,
whose hair was fragrant with musk; a hundred horses, harnessed with gold and silver; a hundred
mules with black hair, with loads of brocade that came from the land of Room and from Persia.
After these they brought and laid at the hero's feet a hundred purses filled with gold pieces;
a cup of rubies, filled with pure musk; another cup of turquoise, filled with attar of roses;
and, last of all, a letter written on pages of silk, in ink made of wine and aloes and amber
and the black of lamps. By this letter the King of kings gave anew to Rustem the kingdom of
the south. Then Kaoüs blessed him, and said: "May you live as long as men shall see the sun
and the moon in heaven! May the great of the earth join themselves to you! May your own soul
be full of modesty and tenderness!"

Rustem prostrated himself on the earth, and kissed the throne; and so took his departure.
