NOTES

ETYMOLOGY OF PENNIEL.

Some eighteen years ago, the writer of the following sonnets, by the kindness of the proprietors
of a pleasant house upon the banks of the Teviot, enjoyed two happy autumns there. The Roman
road which runs between the remains of the camp at Chew Green, in Northumberland, and the Eildon
Hills (the Trimontium of General Roy), passed hard by. The road is yet distinctly visible in
all its course among the Cheviots, and in the uncultivated tracts; and occasionally also, where
the plough has spared it, among the agricultural inclosures.

The house stands near the base of the hill called Penniel or Penniel-heugh: and it is hoped
that the etymological derivation of that word now to be hazarded will not imply in the etymologist
the credulity of a Monkbarns. Pen, it is known, signifies in the Celtic language "a hill".
And the word heil, in the Celto-Scythian, is, in the Latin, rendered Sol. In the Armoric dialect
of the Celtic also, heol means "the sun:" hence, Penheil, Penheol, or Penniel, "the hill of
the sun." Beyond the garden of the abode there stood, and, it is believed, yet stands, a single
stone of a once extensive Druid circle, not many years ago destroyed by the then proprietor,
who used the sacred remains in building his garden wall. A little farther antiquarian conjecture
is necessary to clothe the country with oak woods. Jedwood or Jedworth Forest was part of "the
forest" which covered Selkirkshire and parts of the counties around. The Capon Tree, and the
King of the Wood, two venerable oaks yet flourishing on the water of Jed, attest the once wooded
condition of the land; which is farther irresistibly corroborated by evidence drawn from the
interesting volumes of the Rotuli Parliamentorum. The Bishops of Glasgow had a religious establishment
in the neighbouring sunward village of Nether Ancrum. Of their buildings, of the vicar's house,
or of the ancient gardens existing in the memory of persons living, not a vestige now remains.
In the first volume of the Rotuli, p. 472., there is a Petition, of uncertain date, by the
Bishop of Glasgow to Edward I., then in possession of Scotland, in these terms:--

    "Derechief pry ly dit Evesqe a soen Segur le Roy qe ly plese
    aider &c.... e sur ceo transmettr', sa lettre al vesconte de
    Lanark. E une autre, si ly plest, a ses Forresters de Geddeworth
    de autant de Merin [meremium, meheremium, wood for building]
    pour fere une receite a Allyncrom (Ancrum) desur la marche, ou
    il poet aver recett e entendre a ses ministres qut il le
    voudrent aver."

To which the King's answer is,--

    "Héat Bre Ten' locu R. in Scoc. qd fae'. ei hre meheremiu in
    Foresta de Selkirk et de Maddesleye usq ad numum quinquaginta
    quercu."

Thus, no doubt is left that oak woods abounded in the district; and it was under the influence
of these beliefs that the sonnets were composed:--

  I.

  "'Twas on this spot some thousand years ago,
  Amid the silence of its hoary wood
  By sound unbroken, save the Teviot's flow,
  The lonely Temple of the Druids stood! {450}
  The conquering Roman when he urged his way,
  That led to triumph, through the neighbouring plain,
  And oped the gloomy grove to glare of day,
  Awe-stricken gazed, and spared the sacred fane!
  One stone of all its circle now remains,
  Saved from the modern Goth's destructive hand;
  And by its side I muse: and Fancy reigns;
  And giant oaks on Pennial waving stand;
  With snowy robe and flowing bears sweep bye
  The aged Druid-train beneath the star-lit sky.

  II.

  "The Druid-train has moved into the wood,
  Oh! draw a veil before the hideous scene!
  For theirs were offerings of human blood,
  With sound of trump and shriek of fear between:
  Their sacred grove is fallen, their creed is gone;
  And record none remains save this gray stone!
  Then come the warlike Saxons; and the years
  Roll on in conflict: and the pirate Dane
  Uprears his Bloody raven; and his spears
  Bristling upon the Broadlaw summit's plain
  Spread terror o'er the vale: and still rude times
  Succeed; and Border feuds with conflagration light
  Nightly, the Teviot's wave, and ceaseless crimes
  Chase from the holy towers their inmates in affright.

  III.

  "Land of the South! Oh, lovely land of song!
  And is my dwelling by thy classic streams;
  And is the fate so fondly wished and long,
  Mine in the fullest measure of my dreams,--
  By thy green hills and sunny glades to roam,
  To live among thy happy shepherd swains
  Where now the peaceful virtues have their home;
  A blissful lot! nor aught of grief remains
  Save for that friend, beloved, bewailed, revered,
  To whom my heart for thrice ten years was bound
  By truest love and gratitude endeared:
  The glory of his land, in whom were found
  Genius unmatched, and mastery of the soul,
  Beyond all human wight, save Shakspeare's own controul."

NOTES ON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.

Soho Square.--Your correspondent "NASO" (p. 244.) has anticipated me in noticing Mr. Cunningham's
mistake about Mrs. Cornellys' house in this square; but he has left unnoticed some particulars
which deserve to be recorded. Mrs. Cornellys', or Carlisle House as it was called, was pulled
down at the beginning of the present century (1803 or 1804), and two houses built upon its
site, now Jeffery's Music Warehouse and Weston's Printing Office. Some curious old paintings
representing banqueting scenes, formerly in Carlisle House were carefully preserved until the
last few years, in the drawing-room of the corner house, when they were removed to make room
for some needed "elegancies" of the modern print shops. The Catholic Chapel in Sutton Street
was the banquetting-room of Carlisle House; and the connecting passage between it and the house
in Soho Square was originally the "Chinese bridge."

"Teresa Cornelys, Carlisle House, St. Ann, Soho, dealer" appears in the bankrupt list of The
London Gazette of November, 1772; and in December of the same year, this temple of festivity,
and all its gorgeous contents, were thus advertised to be sold by public auction:--

    "Carlisle House, Soho.--At twelve o'clock on Monday the 14th
    instant, by Order of the Assignees, Mr. Marshall will sell by
    Auction on the Premises, in one Lot, All that extensive,
    commodious, and magnificent House in Soho Square, lately
    occupied by Mrs. Cornelys, and used for the Public Assemblies of
    the Nobility and Gentry. Together with all the rich and elegant
    Furniture, Decorations, China, &c., thereunto belonging, too
    well-known and universally admired for their aptness and taste
    to require here any public and extraordinary description
    thereof. Catalogues to be had at the House, and at Mr.
    Marshall's, in St. Martin's Lane. The curiosity of many to see
    the house, to prevent improper crowds, and the great damage that
    might happen therefrom (and the badness of this season) by
    admitting indifferent and disinterested people, must be an
    excuse to the public for the Assignees ordering the Catalogues
    to be sold at 5s. each, which will admit two to see the house,
    &c., from Monday the 7th instant to the time of sale, Sundays
    excepted, from ten in the morning to three in the afternoon, and
    they hope no person or persons will take amiss being refused
    admittance without Catalogues."

In December 1774, the nobility and gentry were informed (by advertisement), "That the Assemblies
at Carlisle House will commence soon, under the conduct and direction of a New Manager;" but
notwithstanding the efforts of this person, we find that Mrs. Cornellys resumed her revels
here with great spirit in 1776. In 1778, Carlisle House was again publicly advertised to be
sold by private contract, or "to be hired as usual;" and subsequently, after having been used
as a common exhibition room of "Monstrosities," a "School of Eloquence," and "An Infant School
of Genius," it closed its public career through the interference of the magistracy in 1797.

A full and particular account of the rise and fall of "Mrs. Cornelys' Entertainments at Carlisle
House, Soho," was privately printed two or three years ago, by Thomas Mackinlay, Esq., of the
firm of Dalmaine and Co., Soho Square.

Carlisle Street, Soho Square.--The large house at the end of this street, looking into the
square, was formerly called Carlisle House. In 1770 it was purchased of Lord Delaval by the
elder Angelo; who resided in it many years, and built a large riding-school at the back. Bach
and Abel, of "Concert" notoriety, resided in the adjoining house. Carlisle Street was then
called King's Square Court. {451}

Catherine Street, Strand.--In 1714, a tract was published with the following title:--The Maypole's
New Year's Gift or Thanks returned to his Benefactors, humbly inscribed to the Two Corners
of Catherine Street, Strand; written by a Parishioner of St. Mary, Savoy.

Maiden Lane, Covent Garden.--The well known "Cider Cellar" in this lane was opened about 1730.
There is a curious tract, entitled Adventures under Ground, 1750, which contains some strange
notices of this "Midnight Concert Room."

Salisbury Change.--Cibber, in the amusing Apology for his Life, has the following:--

    "Taste and fashion, with us, have always had wings, and fly from
    one public spectacle to another so wantonly, that I have been
    informed by those who remember it, that a famous puppet-show in
    Salisbury Change (then standing where Cecil Street now is),
    so far distressed these two celebrated companies, that they were
    reduced to petition the king for relief against it."

The New Exchange.--A good description of this once popular mart may be found in Lodwick Rowzee's
Treatise on the Queene's Welles, Lond. 1632. It is as follows:--
