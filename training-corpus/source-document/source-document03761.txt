note in the second edition: “Others would give up this passage for the Vera incessu patuit

187. Lydgate. Farmer has a long note here on the versification of Lydgate and Chaucer. “Let
me here,” he says, “make an observation for the benefit of the next editor of Chaucer. Mr.
Urry, probably misled by his predecessor Speght, was determined, Procrustes-like, to force
every line in the Canterbury Tales to the same standard; but a precise number of syllables
was not the object of our old poets,” etc.

His work was originally translated by one Zacharie Jones. My edit. is in 4to, 1605, with an

of Shakespeare.—The passage from Scaliger is likewise to be met with in The Optick Glasse of
Humors, written, I believe, by T. Wombwell; and in several other places” (Farmer). Reed quotes
a manuscript note by Farmer on the statement that it was written by Wombwell: “So I imagined
from a note of Mr. Baker’s, but I have since seen a copy in the library of Canterbury Cathedral,
printed 1607, and ascribed to T. Walkington of St. John’s, Cambridge.”

edition.

Hall’s Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke (1548) was freely
used by Holinshed, but there is a passage in Henry VIII. which shows that the dramatist knew
Hall’s chronicle at first hand.

193. Skelton. “His Poems are printed with the title of Pithy, Pleasaunt, and Profitable Workes
of Maister Skelton, Poete Laureate,” etc. Farmer then explains with his usual learning Skelton’s
title of “poet laureate.”

Pierce Plowman. This reference was added in the second edition. On the other hand, the following
reference, which was given in the first edition after the quotation from Hieronymo, was omitted:

Grimald’s “Three Bookes of Duties, tourned out of Latin into English” appeared in 1555. “I
have met with a writer who tells us that a translation of the Offices was printed by Caxton
in the year 1481: but such a book never existed. It is a mistake for Tullius of Old Age, printed
with the Boke of Frendshipe, by John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester. I believe the former was translated
by William Wyrcestre, alias Botoner” (Farmer).

He wrote histories of England (4 vols., 1744, etc.), the World (12 vols., 1764, etc.), and
Scotland (10 vols., 1767). His Essay upon English Tragedy had appeared in 1747. See note, p. 101.

It hath indeed been said, etc. In the Critical Review, xxiii., p. 50. Accordingly the following
passage (to “Mr. Lort,” foot of p. 199) was added in the second edition.

Saxo Grammaticus. “ ‘Falsitatis enim (Hamlethus) alienus haberi cupidus, ita astutiam veriloquio
permiscebat, ut nec dictis veracitas deesset, nec acuminis modus verorum judicio proderetur.’
This is quoted, as it had been before, in Mr. Guthrie’s Essay on Tragedy, with a small variation
from the Original. See edit. fol. 1644, p. 50” (Farmer). The quotation was given in the Critical
Review, xxiii., p. 50.

198. The Hystorie of Hamblet. It is now known that Shakespeare’s “original” was the early play
of Hamlet, which was probably written by Thomas Kyd, towards the end of 1587. See Works of
Kyd, ed. Boas, Introduction, iv.

Though Farmer disproves Shakespeare’s use of Saxo Grammaticus, he errs in the importance he
gives to the Hystorie of Hamblet. No English “translation from the French of Belleforest” appears
to have been issued before 1608.

Duke of Newcastle, Thomas Pelham-Holles (1693-1768), first Lord of the Treasury, 1754, Lord
Privy Seal, 1765-66, Chancellor of Cambridge University from 1748.

Colman, George, the elder (1732-1794), brought out the Comedies of Terence translated into
familiar blank verse in 1765. He replied to Farmer’s Essay, the merit of which he admitted,
in the appendix to a later edition. 2. In a long footnote in the Essay, Farmer replies also
to an argument advanced by Bonnell Thornton (1724-1768), Colman’s associate in the Connoisseur,
in his translation of the Trinummus, 1767.

translation of the Menaechmi. “It was published in 4to, 1595. The printer of Langbaine, p.
524, hath accidentally given the date 1515, which hath been copied implicitly by Gildon, Theobald,
Cooke, and several others. Warner is now almost forgotten, yet the old criticks esteemed him
one of ‘our chiefe heroical makers.’ Meres informs us that he had ‘heard him termed of the
best wits of both our Universities, our English Homer’ ” (Farmer). See note on p. 9.

Riccoboni, Luigi (1674-1753). See his Réflexions historiques sur les differens théatres de
l’Europe, 1738, English translation, 1741, p. 163: “If really that good comedy Plautus was
the first that appeared, we must yield to the English the merit of having opened their stage
with a good prophane piece, whilst the other nations in Europe began theirs with the most wretched
farces.”

Hanssach, Hans Sachs (1494-1576).

201. Gascoigne. “His works were first collected under the singular title of ‘A hundreth sundrie
Flowres bounde up in one small Poesie. Gathered partly (by translation) in the fyne outlandish
Gardins of Euripides, Ouid, Petrarke, Ariosto, and others: and partly by inuention, out of

202. Gosson. See Arber’s reprint, p. 40.

Hearne, Thomas (1678-1735) edited William of Worcester’s Annales Rerum Anglicarum in 1728.
“I know indeed there is extant a very old poem, in black letter, to which it might have been
supposed Sir John Harrington alluded, had he not spoken of the discovery as a new one, and
recommended it as worthy the notice of his countrymen: I am persuaded the method in the old
bard will not be thought either. At the end of the sixth volume of Leland’s Itinerary, we are
favoured by Mr. Hearne with a Macaronic poem on a battle at Oxford between the scholars and
the townsmen: on a line of which, ‘Invadunt aulas bycheson cum forth geminantes,’ our commentator
very wisely and gravely remarks: ‘Bycheson, id est, son of a byche, ut e codice Rawlinsoniano
edidi. Eo nempe modo quo et olim whorson dixerunt pro son of a whore. Exempla habemus cum alibi
tum in libello quodam lepido & antiquo (inter codices Seldenianos in Bibl. Bodl.) qui inscribitur:
The Wife lapped in Morel’s Skin: or the Taming of a Shrew’ ” (Farmer). Farmer then gives Hearne’s
quotation of two verses from it, pp. 36 and 42.

It may be concluded, says another. Whalley, Enquiry, p. 79.

Jaggard. “It may seem little matter of wonder that the name of Shakespeare should be borrowed
for the benefit of the bookseller; and by the way, as probably for a play as a poem: but modern
criticks may be surprised perhaps at the complaint of John Hall, that ‘certayne chapters of
the Proverbes, translated by him into English metre, 1550, had before been untruely entituled
to be the doyngs of Mayster Thomas Sternhold’ ” (Farmer).

204. Biographica Britannica, 1763, vol. vi. Farmer has a note at this passage correcting a
remark in the life of Spenser and showing by a quotation from Browne’s Britannia’s Pastorals,
that the Faerie Queene was left unfinished,—not that part of it had been lost.

205. Anthony Wood. “Fasti, 2d. Edit., v. 1. 208.—It will be seen on turning to the former edition,
that the latter part of the paragraph belongs to another Stafford. I have since observed that
Wood is not the first who hath given us the true author of the pamphlet” (Fanner). Fasti, ed.
Bliss, i. 378. But Stafford’s authorship of this pamphlet has now been disproved: see the English
Historical Review, vi. 284-305.

Crendon. “It was observed in the former edition that this place is not met with in Spelman’s
Villare, or in Adams’s Index; nor, it might have been added, in the first and the last performance
of this sort, Speed’s Tables and Whatley’s Gazetteer: perhaps, however, it may be meant under
the name of Crandon; but the inquiry is of no importance. It should, I think, be written Credendon;
tho’ better antiquaries than Aubrey have acquiesced in the vulgar corruption” (Farmer). But
Crendon is only a misprint for Grendon.

Hamlet revenge. Steevens and Malone “confirm” Farmer’s observation by references to Dekker’s
Satiromastix, 1602, and an anonymous play called A Warning for Faire Women, 1599. Farmer is

seven years afterward. “Mr. Pope asserts ‘The troublesome Raigne of King John,’ in two parts,
1611, to have been written by Shakespeare and Rowley: which edition is a mere copy of another
in black letter, 1591. But I find his assertion is somewhat to be doubted: for the old edition
hath no name of author at all; and that of 1611, the initials only, W. Sh., in the title-page”
(Farmer).

Nash. This reference was added in the second edition. See Arber’s reprint of Greene’s Menaphon,
p. 17, or Gregory Smith, Elizabethan Critical Essays, i. 307, etc.

“Peele seems to have been taken into the patronage of the Earl of Northumberland about 1593,
to whom he dedicates in that year, ‘The Honour of the Garter, a poem gratulatorie—the firstling
consecrated to his noble name.’—‘He was esteemed,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘a most noted poet, 1579;
but when or where he died, I cannot tell, for so it is, and always always hath been, that most
Poets die poor, and consequently obscurely, and a hard matter it is to trace them to their
graves. Claruit, 1599.’ Ath. Oxon., vol. i., p. 300.—We had lately in a periodical pamphlet,
called The Theatrical Review, a very curious letter, under the name of George Peele, to one
Master Henrie Marle, relative to a dispute between Shakespeare and Alleyn, which was compromised
by Ben. Jonson.—‘I never longed for thy companye more than last night; we were all verie merrie
at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affyrme pleasauntly to thy friende Will, that
he had stolen hys speeche about the excellencie of acting in Hamlet hys tragedye, from conversaytions
manifold, whych had passed between them, and opinions gyven by Alleyn touchyng that subjecte.
Shakespeare did not take this talk in good sorte; but Jonson did put an end to the stryfe wyth
wittielie saying, thys affaire needeth no contentione; you stole it from Ned no doubte: do
not marvel: haue you not seene hym acte tymes out of number?’—This is pretended to be printed
from the original MS. dated 1600; which agrees well enough with Wood’s Claruit: but unluckily
Peele was dead at least two years before. ‘As Anacreon died by the pot,’ says Meres, ‘so George
Peele by the pox,’ Wit’s Treasury, 1598, p. 286” (Farmer).

Romeo. “It is remarked that ‘Paris, tho’ in one place called Earl, is most commonly stiled
the Countie in this play. Shakespeare seems to have preferred, for some reason or other, the
Italian Conte to our Count:—perhaps he took it from the old English novel, from which he is
said to have taken his plot.’—He certainly did so: Paris is there first stiled a young Earle,
and afterward Counte, Countee, and County, according to the unsettled orthography of the time.
The word, however, is frequently met with in other writers, particularly in Fairfax,” etc.
(Farmer).

Painter, vol. ii. 1567, 25th novel. Arthur Broke’s verse rendering, founded on Boaistuau’s
(or Boisteau’s) French version of Bandello, appeared in 1562; and it was to Broke, rather than
to Painter, that Shakespeare was indebted. See P. A. Daniel’s Originals and Analogues, Part

Drama, 1773, ii., p. 3, and Boas’s Works of Kyd, 1901, pp. xiii, civ, and 411. Mr. Boas gives
Hawkins the credit of discovering the authorship of The Spanish Tragedy “some time before 1773,”
but the credit is Farmer’s. Hawkins was undoubtedly indebted to Farmer’s Essay.

211. Henry the fifth, Act iii., Sc. 4.

not published by the author. “Every writer on Shakespeare hath expressed his astonishment that
his author was not solicitous to secure his fame by a correct edition of his performances.
This matter is not understood. When a poet was connected with a particular playhouse, he constantly
sold his works to the Company, and it was their interest to keep them from a number of rivals.
A favourite piece, as Heywood informs us, only got into print when it was copied by the ear,
‘for a double sale would bring on a suspicion of honestie.’ Shakespeare therefore himself published
nothing in the drama: when he left the stage, his copies remained with his fellow-managers,
Heminge and Condell; who at their own retirement, about seven years after the death of their
author, gave the world the edition now known by the name of the first Folio, and call the previous
publications ‘stolne and surreptitious, maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious
impostors.’ But this was printed from the playhouse copies; which in a series of years had
been frequently altered, thro’ convenience, caprice, or ignorance. We have a sufficient instance
of the liberties taken by the actors, in an old pamphlet by Nash, called Lenten Stuff, with
the Prayse of the red Herring, 4to, 1599, where he assures us that in a play of his, called
the Isle of Dogs, ‘foure acts, without his consent, or the least guesse of his drift or scope,
were supplied by the players.’—This, however, was not his first quarrel with them. In the Epistle
prefixed to Greene’s Arcadia, which I have quoted before, Tom hath a lash at some ‘vaine glorious
tragedians,’ and very plainly at Shakespeare in particular; which will serve for an answer
to an observation of Mr. Pope, that had almost been forgotten: ‘It was thought a praise to
Shakespeare that he scarce ever blotted a line. I believe the common opinion of his want of
learning proceeded from no better ground. This, too, might be thought a praise by some.’ But
hear Nash, who was far from praising: ‘I leaue all these to the mercy of their mother-tongue,
that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the translator’s trencher,—that could scarcely
Latinize their neck verse if they should haue neede; yet English Seneca, read by candle-light,
yeelds many good sentences—hee will affoord you whole Hamlets, I should say, handfuls of tragicall
speeches.’ I cannot determine exactly when this Epistle was first published; but, I fancy,
it will carry the original Hamlet somewhat further back than we have hitherto done; and it
may be observed that the oldest copy now extant is said to be ‘enlarged to almost as much againe
as it was.’ Gabriel Harvey printed at the end of the year 1592 Foure Letters and certaine Sonnetts,
especially touching Robert Greene: in one of which his Arcadia is mentioned. Now Nash’s Epistle
must have been previous to these, as Gabriel is quoted in it with applause; and the Foure Letters
were the beginning of a quarrel. Nash replied in Strange Newes of the intercepting certaine
Letters, and a Convoy of Verses, as they were going privilie to victual the Low Countries,
1593. Harvey rejoined the same year in Pierce’s Supererogation, or a new Praise of the old
Asse; and Nash again, in Have with you to Saffron Walden, or Gabriel Harvey’s Hunt is up; containing
a full Answer to the eldest Sonne of the Halter-maker, 1596.—Dr. Lodge calls Nash our true
English Aretine: and John Taylor, in his Kicksey-Winsey, or a Lerry Come-twang, even makes
an oath ‘by sweet satyricke Nash his urne.’—He died before 1606, as appears from an old comedy
called The Return from Parnassus” (Farmer). See Gregory Smith, Elizabethan Critical Essays,

French Alphabet of De la Mothe. “Lond., 1592, 8vo.” (Farmer).

Orthoepia of John Eliot. “Lond., 1593, 4to. Eliot is almost the only witty grammarian that
I have had the fortune to meet with. In his Epistle prefatory to the Gentle Doctors of Gaule,
he cries out for persecution, very like Jack in that most poignant of all Satires, the Tale
of a Tub, ‘I pray you be readie quicklie to cauill at my booke, I beseech you heartily calumniate
my doings with speede, I request you humbly controll my method as soone as you may, I earnestly
entreat you hisse at my inventions,’ ” etc. (Farmer).

Sejanus. See Jonson’s “To the Readers”: “Lastly, I would inform you that this book, in all
numbers, is not the same with that which was acted on the public stage; wherein a second pen
had good share: in place of which, I have rather chosen to put weaker, and, no doubt, less
pleasing, of mine own, than to defraud so happy a genius of his right by my loathed usurpation.”
Jonson is supposed to refer here to Shakespeare.

Capell. Cf. pp. 197 and 198. He describes Edward III. on the title page of his Prolusions or
Select Pieces of Antient Poetry, 1760, as “thought to be writ by Shakespeare.”

Laneham, Robert, who appears in Scott’s Kenilworth. The letter has been reprinted by the Ballad
Society (1871), and the New Shakspere Society (1890). Referring to the spelling of the name,
Farmer says in a note, “It is indeed of no importance, but I suspect the former to be right,
as I find it corrupted afterward to Lanam and Lanum.”

Meres. “This author by a pleasant mistake in some sensible Conjectures on Shakespeare, lately
printed at Oxford, is quoted by the name of Maister. Perhaps the title-page was imperfect;
it runs thus: ‘Palladis Tamia. Wits Treasury. Being the second part of Wits Commonwealth, By
Francis Meres Maister of Artes of both Universities.’ I am glad out of gratitude to this man,
who hath been of frequent service to me, that I am enabled to perfect Wood’s account of him;
from the assistance of our Master’s very accurate list of graduates (which it would do honour
to the university to print at the publick expense) and the kind information of a friend from
the register of his parish:—He was originally of Pembroke-Hall, B.A. in 1587, and M.A. 1591.
About 1602 he became rector of Wing in Rutland; and died there, 1646, in the 81st year of his
age” (Farmer). See Ingleby’s Shakspere Allusion-Books or Gregory Smith’s Elizabethan Critical
Essays. The reference at the beginning of Farmer’s note is to Tyrwhitt’s Observations and Conjectures
upon some passages of Shakespeare, 1766.

the Giant of Rabelais. See As You Like It, iii. 2. 238, and King Lear, iii. 6. 7, 8.

John Taylor. See note, p. 163. “I have quoted many pieces of John Taylor, but it was impossible
to give their original dates. He may be traced as an author for more than half a century. His
works were collected in folio, 1630, but many were printed afterward,” etc. (Farmer). The reference
to Gargantua will be found on p. 160 of the Spenser Society Reprint of the Folio. Taylor refers
to Rabelais also in his Dogge of Warre, id., p. 364.

213. Richard the third. “Some inquiry hath been made for the first performers of the capital
characters in Shakespeare. We learn that Burbage, the alter Roscius of Camden, was the original
Richard, from a passage in the poems of Bishop Corbet; who introduces his host at Bosworth
describing the battle:

    “But when he would have said King Richard died,
    And call’d a horse, a horse, he Burbage cried.”

The play on this subject mentioned by Sir John Harrington in his Apologie for Poetrie, 1591,
and sometimes mistaken for Shakespeare’s, was a Latin one, written by Dr. Legge, and acted
at St. John’s in our University, some years before 1588, the date of the copy in the Museum.
This appears from a better MS. in our library at Emmanuel, with the names of the original performers.

It is evident from a passage in Camden’s Annals that there was an old play likewise on the
subject of Richard the Second; but I know not in what language. Sir Gelley Merrick, who was
concerned in the hare-brained business of the Earl of Essex, and was hanged for it with the
ingenious Cuffe in 1601, is accused, amongst other things, “quod exoletam Tragœdiam de tragica
abdicatione Regis Ricardi Secundi in publico theatro coram conjuratis data pecunia agi curasset”
(Farmer).

213. Remember whom ye are, etc. Richard III., v. 3. 315.

Holingshed. “I cannot take my leave of Holingshed without clearing up a difficulty which hath
puzzled his biographers. Nicholson and others have supposed him a clergyman. Tanner goes further
and tells us that he was educated at Cambridge and actually took the degree of M.A. in 1544.—Yet
it appears by his will, printed by Hearne, that at the end of life he was only a steward, or
a servant in some capacity or other, to Thomas Burdett, Esq. of Bromcote, in Warwickshire.—These
things Dr. Campbell could not reconcile. The truth is we have no claim to the education of
the Chronicler: the M.A. in 1544 was not Raphael, but one Ottiwell Holingshed, who was afterward
named by the founder one of the first Fellows of Trinity College” (Farmer).

214. Hig, hag, hog. Merry Wives, iv. 1. 44.

writers of the time. “Ascham, in the Epistle prefixed to his Toxophilus, 1571, observes of
them that ‘Manye Englishe writers, usinge straunge wordes, as Lattine, Frenche, and Italian,
do make all thinges darke and harde,’ ” etc. (Farmer).

all such reading as was never read. Dunciad, i., line 156, first edition (see Introduction,
p. xliv.; iv., line 250, edition of 1742).

Natale solum. “This alludes to an intended publication of the Antiquities of the Town of Leicester.
The work was just begun at the press, when the writer was called to the principal tuition of
a large college, and was obliged to decline the undertaking. The plates, however, and some
of the materials have been long ago put into the hands of a gentleman who is every way qualified
to make a proper use of them” (Farmer). This gentleman was John Nichols, the printer, whose
History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester appeared from 1795 to 1815.

225. general criticism is uninstructive. Cf. Joseph Warton, Adventurer, No. 116: “General criticism
is on all subjects useless and unentertaining; but it is more than commonly absurd with respect
to Shakespeare, who must be accompanied step by step, and scene by scene, in his gradual developments
of characters and passions,” etc.

Love’s Labour lost. In his edition of L.L.L. (1768), Capell omitted fifteen lines from Biron’s
speech in Act iv., Sc. 3 (iv. 1 in his own edition, p. 54). He did not record the omission.

249. Nothing perishable about him except that very learning, etc. Cf. Edward Young, Conjectures
on Original Composition, 1759, p. 81, and Hurd, Notes on Horace’s Art of Poetry, line 286 (1757,
i., pp. 213, 4): “Our Shakespear was, I think, the first that broke through this bondage of
classical superstition. And he owed this felicity, as he did some others, to his want of what
is called the advantage of a learned education.”

are the peculiarities of Falstaffe’s composition” (p. 107).
