As to the successive appointment and removal of incompetent auditors of marine, for which your
excellency gives credit to the council, I can only say that the benefit of such repeated changes
is by no means apparent. And to revert again to the difficulty of decision, for which your
excellency intimates there is sufficient cause, I beg leave to ask your excellency what just
reason can exist for not condemning these prizes to the captors.
